### House Practice 1 &amp; 2 – Strength In Unity

<iframe allowfullscreen="true" height="569" width="960" frameborder="0" src="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vRMFcWuYaZtcinzBpycy5TeHlnhf_0gjn-ugm5RVkVWqQIOn52Mvq41thES3Q78J6yy2IpHydbLq0OO/embed?start=true&amp;loop=true&amp;delayms=3000"></iframe>

Our Sports Day theme for 2021 is ‘Strength in Unity’. It was chosen by the Sports Day Committee comprising of House Captains / Vice Captains and Sports Leaders led by Mr Liew Koi Chin &amp; Mrs Tan Puay Teng.&nbsp; In view of COVID-19, the theme was picked to remind us to stay strong together as a school to overcome any challenges. &nbsp;  
  
We had 2 House Practices with a completely new format never before carried out.&nbsp; Due to SMM, House Practices were done in class and classes took turns to report to various venues to play Ga Ga Ball or stay within the classrooms to play Minute-to-Win-It games.&nbsp; To foster unity, a non-competitive dance was introduced by the Dance/Cheer Committee from the four Houses (Archer, Chew, Dodsworth and Lee) during House Practice 1 so that all students could participate as a class. The Minute-to-Win-It games included Yank It, Tilt a Cup, Uphill Battle and others which tested our students’ psychomotor and sensory skills.&nbsp; As they competed, laugher and cheers could be heard resounding from the classrooms.  
  
After two rounds of House Practices, Dodsworth cemented their lead and were followed closely by Chew, Archer and Lee respectively. As we look forward to Sports Day on 12th March 2021, may we all strive on to do our very best in the finale of Ga Ga Ball and Minute-to-Win-It games as well as a Kahoot Quiz on ‘All About the Houses’ and a surprise element, only known on Sports Day itself.  
  
Look out for the upcoming Maths &amp; Environment Challenges before Sports Day which will also be included in the Sports Day scoring system between the four Houses!

The Staff of PLMGSS were treated to a delightful breakfast bento to start off their day!

  
Every year, PLMC organises this breakfast fellowship with the Staff of PLMGSS to thank them for their labour of love shown towards the school and the students.  
  
Aside from providing physical sustenance, Pastor Joey also provided spiritual sustenance in the form of an exhortation to all staff.  
  
She shared the account of Jesus’ last meal with His disciples, where He washed His disciples’ feet, taken from John 13:12-17. She touched on the importance of having a servant’s heart, and how acts of service allows the school to be a conducive place of work, study, and play. Pastor Joey also encouraged everyone to serve even those who might not appreciate it, knowing that we had done what was right and good, in building a positive work culture.  
  
The staff enjoyed their fellowship over food, and were indeed thankful to God for the partnership between PLMC and PLMGSS!  

### Student Leaders’ Installation

<iframe allowfullscreen="true" height="569" width="960" frameborder="0" src="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vRrZWu_PccuyFfiguwii-2GFKSFeLNRI9G0sZ0K_impci8IoHFkJbssropzRizGI654ZvIYLk0X0hRr/embed?start=true&amp;loop=true&amp;delayms=3000"></iframe>

On the morning of 22 Feb, we installed our 2021 Student Leaders in a simple and yet meaningful ceremony with Safety Management Measures in place.  
  
Our Class Monitors and Peer Support Leaders exert a class-wide influence as they build a culture of care and support in class. They are positive influencers of mindsets and behaviours and are advocates for the well-being of their friends.  
  
Our Peer-Lites, House Captains, House Vice-Captains and Monitor Council leaders exert a school-wide influence as they organise large-scale events such as the iDiscover Camp for Sec 1s, Mega Camp for student leaders, Teachers’ Day, Parents’ Day, Sports Day, ACES Day and other House-related events. They also strive to be good role models to their peers and juniors, to establish friendships with their Sec 1 juniors, and build a strong PL House spirit in our school.  
  
Together as one, the leaders pledged their service to our school by reciting the Student Leaders Pledge together. Quoting the final section of the pledge,  
  

<p></p><center>“We are committed to grow as leaders  <br>
and grow the teams that we lead,  <br>
putting others before self.</center><p></p>
  
<p></p><center>We will rise up as a student leadership body <br>
To execute each task with zeal and tenacity  <br>
Because we love our school.  </center><p></p>
  
<p></p><center>Together, we can create opportunities  <br>
To make a difference.  <br>
Together, as leaders of PL,  <br>
We will Look Up Lift Up.” </center><p></p>

  
We dedicate the service of our 2021 Class Monitors &amp; Monitor Council, 2021 Peer Support Leaders, 2021 Peer-Lites &amp; 2021 House Leaders to being a life-giving channel of blessing for all in the PL Family! Serve well!

<iframe allowfullscreen="true" height="569" width="960" frameborder="0" src="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vRnIOskvTXyvXmwICdFWjk7zk724f9QDvYwG8Pfnqm_EXVjtM95cMMsGBrK8ialhxo9HLgvweDwbbqP/embed?start=true&amp;loop=true&amp;delayms=3000"></iframe>

PL celebrated the Lunar New Year as ONE-PL family on 11 February via a semi-virtual session.  
  
Right after the morning assembly, the school commemorated the Total Defence Day with the theme, “Together We Keep Singapore Strong” – focusing on the many ways we can put Total Defence into action in our everyday lives.  
  
The Sec 1, 3-5 PL-lites then proceeded with a Paper Cutting activitiy. While this was taking place, the Secondary 2 students moved to the Shaw Hall and Parade Square for an interactive face-to-face celebration.  
  
After the Paper Cutting Activity, the school watched the CNY Virtual Concert, which included the following:  
-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Guzheng Performance  
-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Performance by Rhythmic Gymnastics  
-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Games session  
-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Performance by D’Arts  
-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;CNY video by MIT  
-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Sing-along session  
-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Prize Presentation  
-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Principal’s Lunar New Year address  
  
Before heading off, PL-Lites also offered their CNY wishes to their Form Teachers, non-Form teachers and support staff with a pair of Mandarin Oranges.  
  
Happy Lunar New Year to everyone!

### Total Defence Day 2021: Total Defence in Action

<iframe allowfullscreen="true" height="569" width="960" frameborder="0" src="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vS9xhaLO7i2htgsknY7GR-_jQUh08AINt_i4LpLgDstqBKdLbeh8yIDBSHVlxw3l54yrPA2U1v6FiWT/embed?start=true&amp;loop=true&amp;delayms=3000"></iframe>

Amid this year’s outbreak of COVID-19, Total Defence Day 2021 has never been more relevant. COVID-19 reminds us that threats go beyond physical warfare. Temperature screenings are now a daily routine in schools. School staff and students are wearing masks and doing wipe down conscientiously. Our support staff are also stepping up cleaning and disinfecting processes to keep schools safe for students. We are all rallying together and doing Total Defence in our own way, to fight this invisible enemy.  
  
This year, teachers played a video to remind all how we could overcome the fear of the virus and stay resilient in this fight, which is one of the pillars of Total Defence – Psychological Defence. This was followed by a pledge taking activity, led by National Education Ambassadors and Peer-Lites, and a reflection activity which called for all students to write an action they will take to keep PL safe.&nbsp; &nbsp;  
  
So, “_Together we keep Singapore strong_” is more than just a slogan. This year, it is a chance for all to reflect on how PL-Lites have braved through a crisis year and it is a platform for them to pledge actions to take to face future challenges.  

### Partnership Interaction Tea 2021

<iframe allowfullscreen="true" height="569" width="960" frameborder="0" src="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vRdjxPx1wgnlQxUc83BV28TLXNKnJfO9Ftnm3K2zcE9SzOpqIgLcHSIzLodrTiAwJ4k6BhsDFgR_wWt/embed?start=true&amp;loop=true&amp;delayms=3000"></iframe>

The annual Partnership Interaction Tea with the CCA coaches was held on 5, 8 and 9 Feb 2021. The tea session was opened by Mrs Quek Li Gek, Principal, who shared with the coaches the school’s Mission, Vision and Values. She also updated them on the school’s Safe Management Measures in response to the Covid-19 pandemic. Mrs Era Sidhu, HOD (PE &amp; CCA), was on hand to update the coaches on the school’s CCA policies. Their sharing was followed by face-to-face interaction with the coaches. This gave the school leaders and key personnel an opportunity to engage the coaches on a personal level and gather feedback from them. We would like to thank all coaches who were able to join us.

As part of PL’s tradition, the Chinese New Year Carnival is organised every year during the Lunar New Year period, to engage PL-Lites in a hands-on session on Chinese cultural activities.  
  
This year, PL-Lites taking Malay Language and Tamil Language also participated in this carnival to encourage cultural exchange. The carnival included the following activities:  

*   Chinese calligraphy
*   Bean Painting Art
*   Diabolo “Chinese Yo-yo”
*   Traditional Chinese Games, Pitch-Pot
*   Chinese Idiom Puzzle  
    

  
The students found it extremely fun to try out the many new activities.
