We were also joined by a group of guests - uncles and aunties who collect cardboard boxes on the roads.

On 11 October 2019 (Friday), Paya Lebar Methodist Girls’ School (Primary and Secondary) celebrated our 103rd&nbsp;Founder’s Day with the theme&nbsp;_Remind Me, Dear_&nbsp;_Lord_. In keeping with tradition, the celebrations started with the Thanksgiving Service in the morning and the Thanksgiving and Reunion Dinner in the evening at Fairmont Hotel. The Thanksgiving service was hosted by PL Primary and Mrs Joyce Ang opened the service by thanking the Lord for His many blessings bestowed on PL. The Guest-of-Honour, Bishop Dr Chong Chin Chung, The Methodist Church in Singapore, exhorted us to embark on a life of continuous learning just as Jesus was exemplary in His wisdom and learning. In difficult times, we only need to look to the Lord for grace and wisdom. After his uplifting sermon, we witnessed the students’ exemplification of the HEART values in their achievements over the year through a video montage of the Principals’ Report. Following that, Bishop Dr Chong Chin Chung presented the Service to Education Award to Mrs Annie Teo and the various academic awards to the students. Professor Hum Sin Hoon presented the service and staff awards to the staff for their many years of service. In her valedictory speech, Miss Shayne Lai (Primary) highlighted the importance of HEART values in her education in PL, for ‘an education without the HEART is no education at all’. Miss Enrica Goh Si’En (Secondary) shared how PL transformed her from an introverted and reserved girl to an outspoken and confident Head Prefect. The ceremony closed with the melodious song, ‘_I Lift My Eyes Up’_, by the combined PL Primary and Secondary choirs.  
  
At Fairmont Hotel, PL Alumni, staff and students rejoiced that night in true Thanksgiving spirit. The event was graced by Guest-of-Honour and beloved teacher, Ms Jessie Lai. It was a memorable night of worship and praise of the Lord for his 103 years of blessings. Ms Lai reminisced her fond memories of her teachers, friends and colleagues, particularly the NPCC teachers. Mrs Claudette M. Poulier also partook in the celebration by praying with all of us via a video conference call. The 103rd&nbsp;Founder’s Day celebration was a beautiful one that filled one and all with thankfulness and joy.
