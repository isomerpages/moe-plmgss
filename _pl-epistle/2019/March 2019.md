In line with World Water Day on 22 March, PL(Sec) family went through the water rationing exercise. It was a great time of creating the awareness of how precious water is for everyone! Let us all pledge to 'Make every drop count, every day! '

### Sports Day 2019

Strong Hearts, Strong Minds’ was the theme of PLMGSS’s 44th Sports Day, and it was indeed fitting as students, staff and parents all came together under the blazing hot sun in friendly competition, united under their beloved houses of Archer, Chew, Dodsworth and Lee. Legendary Singapore track queen, Ms Glory Barnabas, a former PL-Lite, graced the event as our Guest-of-Honour.  

  

This year was very special as it included two inaugural events, one held before Sports Day and one on the day itself. For the first time, all Houses competed to produce a healthy, sugar-free yet tasty dish in PL’s version of MasterChef. The winning house that walked away with the judges’ approval was Dodsworth. The Inter-CCA 4x100m relay was another novel event to encourage more student participation. It was a battle between students from the Performing Arts, the Sports &amp; Games, the Uniform Groups and the Clubs &amp; Societies. In an exciting battle in the Sports &amp; Games, it was PL’s Track &amp; Field team that came in first in their group event with Badminton hot on their heels. In other group events, it was The St. John’s Brigade and ELDDS-Drama who won their group events respectively. Without a doubt, the most eagerly anticipated event by both the students and teachers alike was the Cheer Competition. This year, Archer danced and cartwheeled away as Cheer Champions.

  

In the end, it was a hard-fought victory for Dodsworth, who fought off their fiercest rival, Lee and Archer to emerge as the Secondary Champion House.  

  

However, thanks to the quick fast legs of the primary school girls from Lee, who pushed their house as Primary Champion house, ultimately, LEE retained their title as Overall Champion House of 2019, an accomplishment held since 2016!  

  

What a wonderful way to end the school term!

### Sec 5 Blessing the Community 2019

<iframe allowfullscreen="true" height="569" width="960" frameborder="0" src="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vTSirHCsLEO8iA-unA6MyETYhf7IKz8gJL_1lutsAePxcHj5_EM6wC5fedwUVTkKdJ3Gy6xGvQCAsmz/embed?start=true&amp;loop=true&amp;delayms=3000"></iframe>

As part of the Blessing the Community Project this year, PLMGSS has partnered with Habitat for Humanity Singapore in a local home-cleaning programme known as Project HomeWorks. Project HomeWorks is Habitat Singapore’s local initiative where they work with vulnerable persons and families who need help to transform their homes into a safe and sanitary state.  
  
On 2 March 2019, the Secondary 5 students together with their teachers carried out home-cleaning for 2 families living in the rental flats at North Bridge Road. In the spirit of service learning, our students have learnt what it means to be a blessing to others and in turn they have gained a very rich learning experience and opened up their eyes to the world beyond the sheltering walls of PL.  
  
**Pupils’ reflections**  
  
At first when I was told that I had to clean the house, I felt worried and I did not really want to go for it as I was afraid that I will not be able to clean the house well. However, I decided to take up the challenge. Project HomeWorks has helped me to overcome my fear of bugs. The project also taught me teamwork as my classmates and I helped and supported one another as we cleaned the house. I learnt that we should we be thankful for what we have after seeing the kind of environment that these elderly stay in. I used to think that I would never be able to do something like this but now I feel that I would volunteer for more of these projects with my friends.  <br>

Participating in Project HomeWorks has helped me to not take my mother for granted. I realise how tiring it must have been for her when she cleans up our house and I would like to help her more. When we finally completed the cleaning the house, I felt a sense of satisfaction as the house was clean and the owner was very happy with our work.  <br>

Initially, I was scared of cleaning up the bed bugs. However, I told myself that I should do my job sincerely and help improve the life of the elderly owner of the house. I used to think that cleaning up an elderly house is a tough job but after experiencing this FIS project, I feel that it is not that difficult and it can be achieved as long as you have a positive mindset.  <br>
