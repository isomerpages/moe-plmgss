On 21 to 23 January 2019, Paya Lebar Methodist Girls’ School (Secondary) welcomed 18 students and 2 teachers - Head Principal, Ms Eunkyung Cha andMs Boyun Cho, from Kyunghee Girls’ High School as part of our yearly Korean Twinning Programme.&nbsp; While they were here, the Kyunghee girls immersed in school life in PLMGSS, through a buddy – homestay programme. In school, the Kyunghee girls participated in an English media project that introduced Korean culture to PLLites, and drama and music lessons where they engaged in fun and creative activities. These girls also had the opportunity to explore Singapore’s many cultural and historical sites with our PL Lites and their families.&nbsp; The Kyunghee girls and PL Lites formed such a strong bond over the three days that they bid each other a teary farewell on the morning of the 23rd. We hope that this friendship between the two schools continues to blossom in years to come.

**Outstanding PL-Lites**

Some of our students overcame their personal challenges in addition to their academic struggles to prepare and sit for their examinations.

We are pleased to share Isabel’s special personal story:


<img style="width:50%" src="/images/Isabel%20Ang.png">
		 
**Isabel Ang, Sec 4B2**&nbsp;has certainly embodied PL’s HEART values – pursuing excellence in what she sets her mind to do. Posted to the Normal Academic stream in Sec 1, Isabel aspired to be in the Express Stream. With a lot of hard work, determination and support from home and teachers, she was laterally transferred to the Express stream in Sec 3. From there, there was nothing that could stop her. She continued to be diligent and went from strength to strength and was rewarded by being placed on the Dean’s List and was awarded the Edusave scholarship in 2015 and 2016. Despite trying to cope with a more rigorous academic demand, she continued to contribute actively to the school in her role as a Class Monitor and National Education Ambassador. Isabel proved again and again that hard work will always be rewarded. Her teachers will remember her for being helpful, kind and highly motivated towards achieving her goals. When asked the secret to her good results and what kept her motivated, Isabel said,&nbsp;_“I wanted to do my best for myself and my parents. I did not want to fail them. I told myself I would have to be adaptable, despite facing any challenges.”_

  
We are also proud of the following two girls who exemplified our School Core Value of ‘Excellence’ and performed exceedingly well in both the academic and non-academic areas:

<img style="width:50%" src="/images/Loke%20York%20Lum.png">
		 
**Loke York Lum, Sec 4A1**&nbsp;is an all-rounder who aced her O – Level examinations in 2018. She was not only self-motivated and diligent in her studies, she also showed a keen interest in all aspects of school life. As one of the key members of the Executive Committee for the Dance Ensemble, she motivated her dance mates to stay focused and achieve excellence in their craft. She represented the school in numerous competitions and concerts. Her leadership skills were put to the test when she was chosen to be the Sec 4 Level Representative of the Student Monitors Council, where she displayed her ability to inspire and motivate her peers towards promoting a positive school culture. She was a resilient student with excellent time management skills and she was able to balance the demands in both the academic and CCA areas well. York Lum will always be remembered for being respectful and compassionate towards her juniors and her peers. She had this to say when she was asked to give a piece of advice to her juniors who will be taking the O – Level examinations this year,&nbsp;_“Do start studying early so that you can manage your time better, especially towards the end. All the best!”_

<img style="width:50%" src="/images/Charissa%20Wee.png">
		 
**Charissa Wee, Sec 4A2**&nbsp;is definitely someone to keep an eye out for. She has not only got a deep love for learning, but she also displayed her prowess as a member of the track and field team and in the field of Robotics. With such myriad abilities, Charissa learnt early on to think independently, work with minimal supervision and to always manage her time well. As a member of the Prefectorial Board, she strived hard to maintain student discipline and cared for the well-being of others. She was invaluable as a member of the board that oversaw student punctuality and she tapped on her skills in technology and data management to efficiently fulfil her duties. Charissa not only represented the school at numerous track and field competitions, she also broke her personal best record and achieved podium places at various external events. Her leadership skills made her a natural choice for team Captain and she served as a strong link between her peers and the teachers. Charissa also actively participated in inter-school activities such as the World Robot Games International where she was part of the team that clinched the 2nd&nbsp;and 3rd&nbsp;place in 2016 and 2017 respectively. She was asked what kept her motivated and how she was able to excel in so many different fields, she replied,&nbsp;_“I could do it because I did it with God’s help! To achieve our goals, it’s important to manage our time well and prioritise.”_

### A Big Welcome to our New Secondary Ones!

<iframe allowfullscreen="true" height="569" width="960" frameborder="0" src="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vQsmN5t0-TjbnxvZV0e6yyRUQ4U2zWbRV7-YnrmgCsccczX9nLiK1-pqRk4wrcnG0OdfgXwfv8lTacU/embed?start=true&amp;loop=true&amp;delayms=3000"></iframe>

PLMGSS welcomed our new batch of Secondary One students with a series of exciting activities in the iDiscover Camp 2019. The camp is named ‘iDiscover’, in hope that our new students will discover themselves, their peers, their school and their community.  
  
The camp ended on a high as the Secondary One students were officially initiated as PL-Lites, where they proudly pinned on their school badges for the first time! During the Candle Lighting Ceremony, they were commissioned to continue to keep their lights shining wherever they go, and to be a blessing in their community!  
  
Indeed, as the students sang in one voice at the finale night, “_our school is the place we love best!_”
