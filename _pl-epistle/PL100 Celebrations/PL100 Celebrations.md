Paya Lebar Methodist Girls’ School (Primary) and Paya Lebar Methodist Girls’ School (Secondary) celebrate our rich heritage of 100 years in 2016.  From the school’s early humble beginnings of being a small school of just 24 students in 1900s, the school has become a school of choice, with the Primary and Secondary schools together having a combined staff strength of about 250, offering a holistic education to about 3000 students. We thank God for His faithfulness to PL. To God be the Glory!

On 14 October 2016 (Friday), Paya Lebar Methodist Girls’ School (Primary and Secondary) celebrated Founder’s Day, marking 100th anniversary of the school. In keeping with tradition, the celebrations started with the Thanksgiving Service in the morning and concluded with the Thanksgiving and Reunion Dinner in the evening.     

  

This year, the school’s Founder’s Day Thanksgiving Service comprised 3 parts - the Thanksgiving Service, Opening of the Time Capsule in the PL Well and Opening of the newly–renovated PLMGS Museum. Rev Dr Wee Boon Hup, Bishop of The Methodist Church in Singapore, was the Guest of Honour for the morning event.   

  

The Time Capsule in the PL Well, which has been sealed since October 1987, will also be opened. Treasured items holding special memories for the PL family will be taken out. These include the Title Deed of the land the school used to sit on at Boundary Road, a 30-year-old vision for PL written by then-Principal Mrs Winnie Tan, a 30-year-old prayer written by then-Chaplain Pastor Leslie Quahe, school locks and keys from our old Boundary Road premises, our chapel Bible, old PL t-shirts, etc.  Following that, new items reflecting current wishes and memories were placed in the Time Capsule. This Time Capsule will be opened in 30 years' time in 2046.  

  

The PLMGS Museum was officially reopened on 14 October morning by 9 generations of PL-Lites during the Founder’s Day Thanksgiving Service in school. The Museum is set up for visitors to explore and understand the rich culture and heritage that our school is built upon. The museum has been renovated and updated to house our own collection of PLMGS artefacts, representing generations of girls who have passed through our sheltering walls. It is designed to facilitate self-guided tours for current cohorts of PL-Lites from the Primary and Secondary sections and our School Alumni who have been dropping by to reminisce about their school days. The Museum is a place where stories of God's faithfulness and the hard work of our pioneers are told and retold to all who enter.   

  

Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong was the Guest of Honour at PLMGS Centennial Founder’s Day Thanksgiving and Reunion Dinner. This event was the culmination of a year-long celebration of the 100th year of the founding of our school. The theme of the dinner was ‘In Praise and Gladness’. At the event, Prime Minister delivered a speech and launch the 100th Anniversary commemorative book ‘In Praise and Gladness’. This book captures the hearts and minds of current and former staff and students, and documents life-changing lessons gleaned from their time in school.    

  

This event was organized by the PLMGS Alumni Association and supported by the schools. The event was attended by 1200 guests who will be seated at 100 tables in Grand Ballroom and 17 tables in adjoining rooms. The guests comprised the schools’ Board of Management, MOE colleagues, representatives from the Methodist Church, parents, current students, school alumni, teachers and friends of the school. In the words of the reporter from The Straits Times, the gathering was like recess time during school hours where you could hear laughter and chatter filling up the entire ballroom. Everyone who attended the event had a good time and the event was a great success!

### PL Writes (August 2016)

![](/images/PL%20Writes%20Banner.jpg)

As the school approached the third term of its 100th year, PL Writes gave PL-Lites the opportunity to slow down and take stock of the year. Some expressed their feelings for the various PL 100 events that have taken place and penned down their takeaways from participating in these events. Others reflected upon their journey in PL thus far and captured their experiences in PL in their years in school.  
  
  
In documenting their appreciation for the year’s blessings, PL-Lites from different levels and streams captured their reflections in writing in both English and Mother Tongue. Reflections from various students flowed in and representative pieces from different students from different classes were chosen and featured in a Gallery Walk in the PLMGSS Library, PL-Booktique.
