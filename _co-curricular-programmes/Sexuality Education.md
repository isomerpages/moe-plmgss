        <strong>MOE Sexuality Education in Schools<br><br></strong>
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        1. Sexuality Education (SEd) in schools is about enabling students to
        understand the physiological, social and emotional changes they
        experience as they mature, develop healthy and rewarding relationships
        including those with members of the opposite sex, and make wise,
        informed and responsible decisions on sexuality matters. SEd is
        premised on the importance of the family as the basic unit of society.
        This means encouraging healthy, heterosexual marriages and stable
        nuclear family units with extended family support. The teaching and
        learning of SEd is based on respect for the values and beliefs of the
        different ethnic and religious communities in Singapore on sexuality
        issues. <br></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><br></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        2. The <strong>Goals</strong> of Sexuality Education are to:
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        (a) To help students make wise, responsible and informed decisions
through the provision of accurate, current and age-appropriate        <u>knowledge</u> on human sexuality and the consequences of sexual
        activity;
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        (b) To help students know themselves and build healthy and rewarding
relationships through the acquisition of        <u>social and emotional skills</u> of self-awareness, management of
        their thoughts, feelings and behaviours, development of empathy for
        others, possession of effective communication, problem-solving and
        decision-making skills; and
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        (c) To help students develop a moral compass, respect for themselves
        and for others as sexual beings, premised on the family as the basic
unit of society, through the inculcation of        <u>positive mainstream values and attitudes</u> about sexuality. <br></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><br></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        3. The <strong>Key Messages</strong> of Sexuality Education are:
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        (a) Love and respect yourself as you love and respect others;
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        (b) Build positive relationships based on love and respect (which are
        the foundation for strong families);
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        (c) Make responsible decisions for yourself, your family and society;
        and
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        (d) Abstinence before marriage is the best protection against STIs/HIV
        and unintended pregnancies. Casual sex can harm and hurt you and your
        loved ones.

        4. Sexuality Education is delivered in a holistic manner through the
        school curriculum. The content for Sexuality Education is grouped into
        five main themes: Human Development, Interpersonal Relationships,
        Sexual Health, Sexual Behaviour, and, Culture, Society and Law. You may
click        <a href="https://go.gov.sg/moe-sexuality-education-scope">here</a> for more information on the scope of Sexuality Education in the
        school curriculum. <br></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><br></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        5. The subjects that incorporate topics on sexuality include:
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        a. Science
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        b. Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) <br></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><br></p>

        :
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        6. The values and attitudes of our youth towards sexuality are
        increasingly shaped by their peers, exposure to the media, popular
        culture and the internet. Adolescence is a complex stage in life as the
        adolescent attempts to find his/her own identity and often struggles
        with new social relationships. The period of middle adolescence
        (generally from 15 – 17 years old) can be a turbulent period for
        adolescents. The gap between physical and emotional/cognitive maturity
        may result in a tendency to act on impulse, experiment with various
        activities (including sexual activities), sometimes without
        understanding the unpleasant consequences that may arise from such
        experimentation. The need for peer acceptance can be overwhelmingly
        strong, and hinder one’s ability to act responsibly. Given the
        pressures faced by the middle adolescent from within themselves and
        from peers, it is important to build a strong sense of self-worth,
        personal conviction and an understanding of the possible consequences
        of sexual behaviour. <br></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><br></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        7. Through the Sexuality Education lessons, secondary students will
        have the opportunity to develop a positive self-esteem, develop their
        character, and expand their understanding and repertoire of skills to
        deal with various issues related to sexuality, which are of prime
        concern at this age.

                            adolescent’s curiosity on matters related to
                            sexuality – masturbation and pornography. Students

                            issues related to viewing, downloading and/or
                            distributing pornography. While students may

                        This lesson focus on how the family, culture and
                        society can influence one’s perception of their gender
                        roles. Students will learn what gender stereotypes are
                        (e.g. males traditionally as breadwinners and females
                        traditionally as doing household chores) and how gender
                        stereotypes are formed. Students will discuss how one’s
                        understanding of gender roles should not be limited by
                        gender stereotypes, for example women can be pilots,
                        while men can be nurses.

                    <p>
                        Students learn to focus on their personal strengths to
                        pursue their interests and build their self-
                        confidence.

                        Students will also learn about the definitions of
                        biological sex, gender identity, gender expression and
                        sexual orientation. They will learn to treat everyone
                        with respect and empathy.

                        This lesson focuses on the issue of online grooming and
                        cyber-flashing. It emphasises the need for

                        and extend a call to action to students to taking
                        appropriate decisions to safeguard their well-being and
                        safety.

                        This lesson focuses on respect for personal boundaries;
                        and how to be safe from risky sexual behaviour, teenage
                        pregnancy and abortion. Students will learn the
                        importance of respecting one another’s boundaries in
                        relationships. This lesson emphasises the importance of

                        legal consequences of having sex with a minor, abortion
                        and the abandonment of babies.

                            one’s self-esteem on our mental well-being as well
                            as relationships with others. Students will also
                            learn how emotional reactions can affect
                            relationships positively or negatively. Students
                            will also learn that maturity and readiness are
                            important when entering into a dating relationship.

                            and make informed decisions in the contexts of

                            user. It will also deepen students’ convictions
                            about making moral decisions by taking into
                            consideration the impact of their decisions and

                            have a right and responsibility to be safe and
                            protect their personal space and body. They also

                        relationships and build their help-seeking skills.
                        Students will learn to identify potential signs of an
                        unhealthy relationship and recognise the different
                        forms of dating violence. They will get to understand
                        why dating violence occurs, why victims often feel
                        “trapped” in such unhealthy relationships, and how one
                        can get out of such a relationship safely. Students
                        will learn when, where and how to seek help from
                        trusted adults (e.g. family, teachers, school
                        counsellors) in the supportive environment that they
                        have if they or their friends are involved in an
                        unhealthy relationship.

                            defined in Singapore as a union between a man and a
                            woman, requires mutual commitment and effort like
                            the other relationships in their lives, what sets a
                            marriage apart is its lifelong commitment. Students

        8. <em>eTeens</em> is a programme developed by Health Promotion Board,
        in collaboration with the Ministry of Education, to provide Secondary 3
        students with accurate information on STIs, HIV and protection from a
        health perspective. <em>eTeens</em> is conducted in two segments – a
        mass talk segment and a classroom-based programme. <br></p><p><br></p>
    <p>
        9. Students are taught skills such as decision-making, assertiveness
        and negotiation to say “no” to sex and negative peer pressure. They
        also learn that the impact of STIs/HIV extends beyond themselves and
        involves their family. Abstinence and upholding family values are the
        key messages. The desired outcome of the <em>eTeens</em> programme is
        that students are empowered to make wise, informed and sensible
        decisions.</p><p><br>
