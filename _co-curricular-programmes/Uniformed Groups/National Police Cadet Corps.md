<p>PL National Police Cadet Corps (NPCC) instils discipline and responsibility
in our cadets, shaping them into engaged citizens. Our training has expanded
beyond traditional regimental drills to include interactive programs like
Crime Scene Investigation, Unarmed Tactics, and First-Aid awareness. Cadets
also contribute through Road Safety Park duties and community events with
the Woodleigh Neighbourhood Police Centre, fostering valuable public engagement
skills. Additionally, our Unit strengthens camaraderie and teamwork through
area-based activities with other NPCC units, building bonds across schools.</p>
<p><strong>Vision</strong> 
<br>To mould the builders of a safe and secure home</p>
<p><strong>Mission</strong> 
<br>To develop its cadets into caring and responsible citizens</p>
<p><strong>Motto</strong>

<p>With enthusiasm, the cadets ensure that they give of their very best in
everything they do. With determination, the cadets ensure that they do
not give up easily and instead persevere, achieving the best in whatever
they do. This encourages cadets to live their lives to the fullest and
what we hoped to achieve.</p>

<br>We, the members of the National Police Cadet Corps,
<br>do here and now, solemnly and sincerely pledge that:
<br>We will always bear true faith and allegiance to the President and our
