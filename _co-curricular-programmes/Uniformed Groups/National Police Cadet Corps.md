The PL National Police Cadet Corps (NPCC) inculcates core values such as discipline, loyalty, integrity, resourcefulness, tenacity and civic-consciousness in cadets to develop them into caring and responsible citizens. Training has evolved from just drills to more structured and meaningful training programmes such as the Crime Scene Investigation Course, Community Outreach and Unarmed Tactics programme. In addition, bonds are forged through competitions, activities, and parades that the unit participates in such as the Inter-Area Drill Competition, Inter-Area Shooting Competition, the NPCC Annual Parade (NPAP), NDP school parade and more.
