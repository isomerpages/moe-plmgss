The Girls’ Brigade 4th Company (4S) is a values-driven Uniformed Group that teaches Girls to lead and serve by example – to put others before self. In The Girls’ Brigade, ‘Servant Leadership’ changes the leader in every Girl as she changes the world.

Our CCA experiences are also anchored in the four-fold programme:
Service, Physical, Educational, and Character Development

The Senior programme provides Girls with opportunities to develop a strong sense of servant leadership. Equal attention is given to cultivating the character and values of the leader as well as the skills needed to lead with compassion and empathy.

  
**Mission**  <br>
