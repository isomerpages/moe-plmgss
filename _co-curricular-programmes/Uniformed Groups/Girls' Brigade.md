<p>In 2024, the Girls’ Brigade 4S celebrates its 85th Anniversary with the
theme “Called 4 Service,” inspired by Mark 10:45, embracing a spirit of
excellence through service. A key highlight was the Girls’ Brigade Friendship
Day, where we doubled previous records by adopting and delivering 85 gifts
to beneficiaries of the Anglican Senior Centre. Looking ahead, we’re excited
to collaborate with World Vision to support beneficiaries in Nepal. Reflecting
on this milestone, we enriched our fourfold programme, introducing drill
dance, knot-tying, and Semester 2 collaborations with the Singapore Police
Force for a dynamic Badgework experience. Our partner, Paya Lebar Methodist
Church, joined us in delivering gifts and sharing devotion, and we engaged
parents through heartfelt letters presented during the Enrolment Parade.
We’re also involving our school community, rallying them to craft macramé
gifts for beneficiaries and support our annual Girls’ Brigade Fortnight.
To fulfil the vision "Every Girl a Leader," we’re expanding opportunities
through a new Company Camp and leadership roles in school assemblies and
weekly devotion activities. This year has strengthened our mission and
commitment to serving and growing together.</p>
