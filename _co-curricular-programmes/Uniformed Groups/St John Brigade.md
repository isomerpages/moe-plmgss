<p>As we move beyond the Covid years, our St John Brigade cadets are more
enthusiastic than ever to grow as first aiders, leaders, and individuals.
This year has been incredibly rewarding, with cadets participating in the
District First Aid Competition and one team advancing to the National First
Aid Competition at Nanyang Polytechnic, held in collaboration with Singapore
General Hospital. This experience offered valuable insights into Singapore’s
nursing industry. Learning never stops at St John—our cadets attend instructor
courses in First Aid, Home Nursing, and Foot Drills, sharing their knowledge
with peers to foster a culture of continuous learning. They also participate
in key events like the Trooping-of-Colours Parade and community outreach
at nearby nursing homes. Our motto, “Hearts of Resilience,” came to life
during our 2D1N March camp, which strengthened values of perseverance,
teamwork, and support. Reflecting on the year, cadets recognize the importance
of these values during challenging moments. With the support of Teachers-in-Charge
and VALs, PLMGSS St John Brigade remains committed to developing cadets
who can make life-saving impacts on their community. We look forward to
another meaningful year in 2025. To God be the Glory!</p>
