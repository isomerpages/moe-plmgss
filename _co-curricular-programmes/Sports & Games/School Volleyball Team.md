Established in 2009, the PL Volleyball team is officially 14 years old this year. The team aspires to develop our girls to be confident, disciplined and competent team players. We recognise each player’s potential and continually create opportunities develop this to the fullest. Through the weekly trainings, the girls not only get to hone the essential technical skills, they also get to make friends and have fun. 

2023 has been a breakthrough year for the team, as we saw our girls clinching the Zonal title. We certainly look forward to building on this experience.
