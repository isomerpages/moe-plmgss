Netball is a fast-moving, non-contact sport which cultivates our players to be quick, alert and to have a persevering mindset on or off-court. Netball instils sportsmanship, discipline, teamwork and perseverance in all players. Being mentally resilient is key for our players as they continue training diligently through all the sessions. With these skills and characteristics, the CCA has and will continue to strive to make PLMGS proud!
