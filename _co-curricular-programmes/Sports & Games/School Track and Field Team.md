PL Track and Field Team is a family of athletics that train together as a team. Our mission is to build a team of national athletics and to do our school proud. We aim to achieve more in the future national championships. Currently, our main coach, Mr Alfred Sim, who was a former national sprinter, coaches us at least twice a week. We aim to expand our track family, welcoming new track members with a sense of belonging, to become members of the team, and achieving something together in the future.
