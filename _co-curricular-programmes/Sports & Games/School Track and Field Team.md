<p>Track &amp; Field experienced a fulfilling year in 2024. The Trackers
have participated in many events and competitions such as NSG Track &amp;
Field, NSG Cross Country, Singapore Athletics All-Comers Meet 2 and Cougar
Cross Country. Strong bonds are forged with activities organised by the
student leaders and members willingly go the extra mile to support one
another in the CCA. Our coaches, Ms Brenda Ter and Ms Ng Yew Cheo helped
to identify the talents of students and prepare our athletes well for the
National School Games (NSG). We also welcome our new Secondary One members
who are full of enthusiasm. We are proud of our members’ achievements in
NSG Track and Field Championship and see the potential for more breakthroughs.
We will continue to groom our student-athletes, with the goal of putting
the PL School Flag and our PL Track Banner at the national stadium for
the next NSG to mark our achievements!</p>
<p><strong>Our Vision</strong> 
<br>Faster, Higher, Stronger</p>
<p><strong>Our Mission</strong> 
<br>To build a team of National athletics with passion and discipline to live
a full life!</p>
