<p>The PL swim team had a fulfilling and fun year in 2024! Our swimmers have
worked hard and put in effort throughout the months leading up to NSG.
This year, our B Division Relay was able to clench 4th position in the
Medley Relay.</p>
<p>In addition, two of our C Division swimmers managed to clench 4th position
in their Individual events 50m Backstroke and 100m Breaststroke. Through
this experience, we have learnt how to improve greatly as well as bond
together as a team.</p>
<p>Our weekly training has instilled resilience and perseverance in our swimmers.
All in all, our efforts as a team have paid off with PL swimmers performing
well and showing improvement in respective individual timings.</p>
<p>Our occasional bonding sessions in school have also helped the entire
CCA to get to know each other better outside of the pool and gotten closer.
Through the many games planned out by swimmers from different levels, our
swimmers have had an enjoyable and memorable time getting to know each
other and building stronger bonds within the team.</p>
<p>During our pool sessions, we have friendly team matches, which has allowed
every CCA member to participate in and work together as a team. This has
allowed each member to tap on one another’s strengths.</p>
<p>Through such CCA experiences, each swimmer is able to learn on their areas
for improvement as pointed out and corrected by coaches and fellow swimmers.
Thus, allowing us to constantly improve over time while also being able
to achieve our goals overtime.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Vision</strong>

<p><strong>Mission</strong>
