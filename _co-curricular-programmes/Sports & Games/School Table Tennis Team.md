<p>The PL table tennis team has had an exciting and fulfilling 2024! Our
team put in much effort in the months leading up to NSG, training hard
throughout the November and December holidays in preparation for our NSG
in Semester 1. This is also the first year that our C Division played in
the Pool format instead of the Zonal format. Our efforts paid off when
we emerged top of our Pool, leading by a huge margin.</p>
<p>This year, bonding sessions in school have helped the entire CCA to get
to know each other better. Through the many games, our girls have had a
fun and memorable time getting to know each other. This has built stronger
bonds within the team. During our training sessions, we conducted friendly
team matches, which has allowed every member to work together in our little
teams. This has allowed each member to tap on each other’s strengths. Through
such CCA experiences and reflections, each player gains awareness of her
own individual areas for improvement, which sets her up for continuous
improvement and growth.</p>
