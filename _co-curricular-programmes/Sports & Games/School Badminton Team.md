dedication and commitment in various tournaments. Our C Division Girls
team achieved a significant milestone by securing a Top 16 position in
the NSG Badminton C Division Girls League 1. We also successfully organized
the PL Methodist Badminton Cup 2024, a testament to our players' skill
and teamwork. The collaboration among our teachers, coaches, and PLBT players
has been instrumental in preparing our teams for future challenges, and
we look forward to another exciting year ahead.</p>
