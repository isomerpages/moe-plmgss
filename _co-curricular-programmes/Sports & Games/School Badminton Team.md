Our journey in 2021 was challenging but yet amazing one! PL badminton (PLBT) strove for the best and worked exceptionally hard during trainings. Our B Division made it into the top 8 of the East Zone Inter-School badminton championship. The C Division Championship was cancelled due to the situation of Covid-19.  
  
PLBT is one big family where everyone embraces and appreciates one another’s unique qualities. To bring PLBT to greater heights, we have regular trainings within the guidelines of the Safe Management Measures for schools. Teachers and students continue to forge stronger team-bonding relationships and friendships. Together, we seek to strive for excellence as a disciplined team.
