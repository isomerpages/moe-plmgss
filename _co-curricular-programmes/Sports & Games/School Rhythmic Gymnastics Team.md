Rhythmic Gymnastics is a sport that incorporates elements of classical ballet, dance, gymnastics, and apparatus manipulation. High degrees of athletic skill and ability such as flexibility, agility, dexterity strength, coordination and endurance, are required in Rhythmic Gymnastics movements.

Since the setting up PLMGS(S) Rhythmic Gymnastics Team in 2017, the girls have participated in a number of competitions. We look forward to striving hard to grow and build a strong team together.
