Rhythmic gymnastics is a sport that incorporates elements of classical ballet, dance, gymnastics, and apparatus manipulation. High degrees of athletic skill and ability such as flexibility, agility, dexterity strength, coordination and endurance, are required in Rhythmic Gymnastics movements.  
  
The PLMGS(S) Rhythmic Gymnastics Team was formed in 2017 with enthusiasm and our gymnasts took part in the National Inter-School Rhythmic Gymnastics Championship in both the Individual and Group categories.
