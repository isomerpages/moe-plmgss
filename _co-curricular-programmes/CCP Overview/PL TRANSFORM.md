<p>In PL, we believe that each child is special and her potential is fully realised when she is nurtured morally, intellectually, socially and physically. Our aim is to foster an environment that promotes order and discipline, enabling students to focus on their learning while developing self-management skills and integrity.</p><p>Our discipline committee, known as 'PL Transform,' embodies our dedication to guiding students through their mistakes and cultivating their character. We employ the 4Rs approach—Recognition, Restitution, Reconciliation, and Resolution—to facilitate this process. Facilitation questions based on Restorative Practice were integrated into our processes to guide our students in recognising their mistakes, making restitution, having reconciliation with the affected people and making resolution to not make the same mistake again.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition, the PL Transform team regularly conducts character talks and inter-class student management competitions, emphasizing the importance of the school’s HEART values.</p>
