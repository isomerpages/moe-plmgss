**Aesthetics Extension Programme**  

The Aesthetics Extension Programme gives students a choice in Secondary Two to develop further in an area of Art that they are interested in or to choose drama instead. The students do 2 terms of Art in Secondary Two. In the 3rd term, they have a choice to offer Advanced Art, Digital Art or Drama depending on their interest and what they would like to pursue. Advanced Art prepares students serious about pursuing Art at GCE N- or O-Level. Digital Art equips students with IT skills in Art, while Drama and Theatre is an extension of the Drama curriculum in Secondary One, enhancing students’ skills in drama. This differentiated programme gives students the autonomy to choose the Arts-related area that they are more comfortable with.  
  
**Co-Curricular Programme**  

The Co-Curricular Programme develops students’ skills in music, drama, dance or visual art through training via their selected CCAs. Besides their weekly training with the instructors, there are also workshops, school exchanges and competitions. Students are given opportunities to showcase their talents. Every student in the CCAs will have an opportunity to apply what they have learnt through performances like concerts or exhibitions for photographic, art & design products to be on display.
