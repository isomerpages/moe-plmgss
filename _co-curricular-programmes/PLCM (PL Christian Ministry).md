The Christian ministry aligns itself with the school by teaching and reiterating good moral values based on the Bible during weekly Chapel sessions and daily morning devotions.    
  
**Mission:**  
To proclaim the God of the Bible and to instil Christ-likeness as the way of life, as we challenge the disciples (i.e. believers) and motivating every person to live out the abundant life that God has planned for us.  
  
**Vision:**  
A school with staff and students who live their lives as fearfully and wonderfully created individuals made in the image of God, exhibiting positive character traits.  
  
**Verse:**  
Proverbs 22:6 "Train a child in the way he (she) should go, and when he (she) is old, he (she) will not turn from it."  
  
Proclaiming God, Learning Christ-likeness, Challenging the disciples, Motivating every person.  
  
Paya Lebar Methodist Church provides chaplaincy and spiritual direction for the school through support from the Pastoral Team and provision of 1 Christian Ministry Staff, Mrs Irene Phua, who is based in the school premise.
