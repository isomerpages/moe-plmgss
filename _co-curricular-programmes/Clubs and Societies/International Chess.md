Unlike all other CCAs, PL Chess Club is a Special Interest Group. Our members are closely bonded by the different experiences shared through competitions, team events and practice sessions. In every competition, we learn new things about chess and one another. During practice sessions, it is heartening to see everyone working together. Our members always look forward to applying them whenever we play against one another or others.  
  
We took part in National Inter-School Team Chess Championships in 2020, reinforcing our love for the craft and pride for the interest group.  
  
We look forward to meeting students who have a knack for playing chess or would like to learn how to play it. This club does not come under the purview of CCAs, and so students will still need to join a CCA.
