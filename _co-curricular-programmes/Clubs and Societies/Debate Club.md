<p>PL Debate empowers students with intellectual and oratorical skills, honing
their critical and adaptive thinking as well as their ability to articulate
arguments from diverse perspectives. It deepens their understanding of
key issues and policy debates, challenges assumptions, and broadens perspectives.
This year, our debaters have significantly enhanced their research and
presentation skills, proving their mettle in competitions such as the Singapore
Secondary Schools Debating Championships, Raffles Debate Academy U14s Debating
Championships, Dialogic Academy Debating Championships, and the Thoburn
Cup. These platforms offer our students the opportunity to spar with like-minded
peers, fostering rigorous argumentation and higher order thinking skills.</p>
