Offering the best of both worlds, Media and Information Technology Club immerses its members in the world of media, infocomm and audio visuals. The club aims to excite members in the use of technology in a fun and meaningful way. Weekly sessions include coding, digital art, video production, DJ &amp; Music production and more. Leadership skills and an entrepreneurial spirit are cultivated through participation in various competitions and innovative projects.

Furthermore, our recently introduced special segment, MITV, helps to hone membersâ€™ creativity and videography skills.
