PL Debate offers students, who are seeking intellectual and oratorical challenges, a plethora of opportunities to engage in riveting discussions that will stretch their imagination, challenge their opinions, and broaden their perspectives on critical issues. Through these, students hone their research and presentation skills as well. Debaters participate in numerous debate competitions including Singapore Secondary Schools Debating Championships (Division I), Orator’s Trophy, Raffles Debate Academy and Thoburn Cup. Through such platforms, our debaters get to interact with like-minded people who are passionate about analysing the rigour of arguments and mastering higher order thinking skills.
