The Photography Club started her journey into digital photography in 2006. Since then, the club has grown from strength to strength. The club grew in size as well as capability. Today the Photography Club owns an array of digital photographic equipment to cater to the needs of the students and school. The Photography Club is involved in almost all school events, capturing every precious moment and leaving footprints for those who come after her.  
  
The Photography Club has about 30-40 members now, and it has a structured mentorship program where the seniors guide the juniors. A professional photographer cum trainer is engaged by the club to continue to mentor the students in their photography journey. The Photography Club also has a strong link with Canon Singapore, with Canon supporting the club in terms of equipment as well as through organising activities. The club communicates mostly online via Facebook and Google Drive. Ideas and information are shared not only within the school, but also with students from other schools. Some of our students’ works are captured at&nbsp;[http://eosworld.canon.com.sg](http://eosworld.canon.com.sg/)  

  

As for this year 2021, The Photography Club conducted training sessions via the online platform, Zoom. This is to ensure that our students can continue to learn photography skills even at home. New modules like mobile photography, creative writing in photography have been added in.
