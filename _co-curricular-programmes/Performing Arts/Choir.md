The Paya Lebar Methodist Girls' School (Secondary) Choir is also known as One Voice, as we aim to glorify God through singing. The love of music is a Methodist heritage and as a girls’ school with the Mission, Vision and Core Values promoting the culture of graciousness, we seek to inculcate a passion for singing in each of our choristers, and in the process mould them into all-round and gracious student leaders under the guidance of God.  
  
One Voice has, in providing opportunities for growth and joy to the choristers, been contributing actively to the vibrant school culture. It performs regularly in school concerts and musical productions such as Musical Montage, Symphony of Praise concerts and PL musicals. The choir has also been invited to be featured as a guest item in choir concerts staged by other schools such as River Valley High School, Methodist Girls’ School and St Andrew’s Secondary School. In addition, One Voice has performed at the Esplanade Concert Hall under the auspices of the Pipes and Pedals concert series organised by the Esplanade – Theatres by the Bay. The choir has also been invited to perform at public events during various festivities such as Chinese New Year, National Day and Christmas. Since 2014, they have performed at Christmas Wonderland Event @ Gardens by the Bay and Hotel Grand Park City Hall. Since 2016 PL One Voice has been identified to perform at Esplanade Concert Hall under the Limelight series to showcase excellent school choirs.
