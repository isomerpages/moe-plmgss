<p>The Paya Lebar Methodist Girls' School (Secondary) Choir, known as PL
One Voice (PLOV), is a vibrant ensemble committed to glorifying God through
song. Actively contributing to the school’s cultural life, PLOV provides
a nurturing space for choristers to grow musically and personally. Guided
by our conductor, PLOV explores an extensive repertoire spanning Renaissance

unity, resilience and the courage to step beyond their comfort zones. This

and the dedication of every member in striving for excellence together.</p>
