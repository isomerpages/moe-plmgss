<p>In 2024, Chinese Drama has been a fulfilling and inspiring journey for
our members. As the only Chinese-speaking CCA in our school, we are a vibrant,
close-knit community dedicated to expressing ourselves through the Chinese
language and culture. This year, we strengthened our bonds and grew together
through intensive drama training, memorable performances and meaningful
moments during the Sec 4 farewell and bonding sessions. A highlight was
our performance at the Paya Lebar Chinese New Year Dinner at the Kovan
Hub, where we captivated the audience and proudly showcased our talents.
With passion and unity, we look forward to creating lasting memories and
inspiring others through Chinese Drama.</p>
