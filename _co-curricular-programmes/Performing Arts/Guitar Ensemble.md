<p>2024 has been a fulfilling year marked by growth and enriching experiences.
Being invited to perform at the Sustainable Kids Market KIDSforKIDS Showcase

work. Our performances at Musical Montage and National Day provided us
with invaluable platforms to showcase our talents and growth, both individually
and as an ensemble. Looking back on our journey, we are proud of how far
we have come and remain committed to learning, growing, and excelling in
every opportunity that comes our way.</p>
