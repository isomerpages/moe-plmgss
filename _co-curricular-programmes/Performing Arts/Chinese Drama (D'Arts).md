Chinese Drama (D’Arts) is a fun and enjoyable CCA with energetic and friendly members. Being the only Chinese-speaking CCA in the school, we embody strong passion and love for the Chinese language and culture. Through our CCA, there are many opportunities for us to experience various roles and unleash our emotions. One such example would be through the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF). It is where we are exposed to more acting opportunities and the spirit of teamwork as we work together to present the play. D’ARTS aims to nurture our members into confident and outspoken performers and speakers and members of D’ARTS are constantly striving for betterment.&nbsp;
