Chinese Drama (D’Arts) aims to nurture our members into confident and outspoken performers and speakers. It is a fun and enjoyable CCA with energetic and friendly members. Being the only Chinese-speaking CCA in the school, we embody strong passion and love for the Chinese language and culture. Most importantly, members of D’ARTS are constantly striving for betterment. 

There are many opportunities for our members to unleash their emotions and creativity as they learn and perform various roles. One such platform is the Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation. From preparation to the final performance on stage, our members develop a sense of teamwork and they work together to present the play.
