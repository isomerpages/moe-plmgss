<p>2024 has been a pioneering year of growth and progress for the Guzheng
Ensemble. Under the guidance of a new Guzheng coach, the ensemble has embraced
change with a proactive and positive attitude, showing remarkable adaptability.
Upholding our commitment to holistic student development, we introduced
a Student Development Plan tailored for the Guzheng team. From daily practices
to performances and competitions both within and beyond the school, our
students consistently embody a spirit of excellence. Their collaborative
and heartfelt performances were warmly received at the school's New Year
celebration and Musical Montage 2024, highlighting their dedication and
passion.</p>
