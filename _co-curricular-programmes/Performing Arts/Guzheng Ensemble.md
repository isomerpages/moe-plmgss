The PL Guzheng Ensemble was established in 1989 and made its debut in 1991 at the biennial Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) Central Judging of Instrumental Ensembles (Secondary Schools) and received a Gold Award. Since then it has been blessed with seven consecutive Gold Awards (1991 to 2003), four Gold with Honours (2005 to 2011), and five Distinction award (2013, 2015, 2017, 2019, 2021), the highest achievements possible for each SYF.  
  
The ensemble has performed at various school events and concerts as well as events organised by MOE, North East CDC and many other organisations. For example, the ensemble performed at River Hongbao Chinese New Year celebration and Ministry of National Development's annual get-together dinner event to celebrate the Lunar New Year. It also presented an online showcase at the 2020 World Congress of International Association of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and Allied Professions  
(IACAPAP).  
  
Over the years, the ensemble has been working hard towards excellence and has developed strong bonding among the members, each being united by the 21 strings of their guzheng. Driven by their strong belief that their attitude determines their altitude, they therefore strive to develop everyone’s character and moral value system to bring out the best in every member.  
  
The ensemble also strives to live out the school values of being women after God’s own&nbsp;**H.E.A.R.T**. It holds fast to the values of&nbsp;**H**onouring God, having an&nbsp;**E**xcellence mindset and being&nbsp;**A**daptable,&nbsp;**R**espectful towards others and remains&nbsp;**T**hankful at all times.  
  
**Vision**  <br>
PL Guzheng Ensemble will be a disciplined and united body in making a joyful noise unto Lord and men.  
  
**Mission**  <br>
To create ourselves into expressions of music.
