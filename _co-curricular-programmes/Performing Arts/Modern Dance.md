<p>2024 has been a year of growth and discovery for every member of PL Dance.
From the enthusiastic Secondary 1 newcomers to the experienced Secondary
4 veterans, each dancer had the opportunity to captivate audiences with
grace and synchrony during PL Musical Montage 2024. United by a shared
passion for dance, the team demonstrated resilience, camaraderie and mutual
support, creating a safe space for all to strengthen individual skills
without compromising team unity. After every practice, the executive committee
offered constructive feedback to build capacity, affirm efforts, and elevate
standards. Together, PL Dance is ready to forge ahead and reach new heights!</p>
