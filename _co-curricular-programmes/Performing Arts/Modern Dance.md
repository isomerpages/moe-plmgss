PL Dance started in 2003 with a small number of students. Over the years we have grown in numbers and flourished from the many meaningful performance opportunities. The group has taken part in the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) Central Judging, achieving Gold with Honours in 2009, Gold in 2011 and Certificate of Distinction in 2013, 2015 &amp; 2017. The dance group has also contributed to the community by putting up many public performances. In 2012, the dance group put up a performance for the patients at Singapore General Hospital. The group also performed at other prestigious events like the National Kidney Foundation Charity and Gala Dinner in 2011, and the Youth Olympic Games Dance Fantasia 2010. Through our dance practices and gatherings, close bonds and greater esprit de corps have been built. Our dancers also take initiative in planning their costumes, rehearsals and are very disciplined, poised and confident.
