PL Cherubs Harp Ensemble is the first school harp ensemble in Singapore and was founded in 1998. The ensemble has been performing in numerous concerts, festivals and performances. The harp ensemble has shown consistent and outstanding performances in the Singapore Youth Festival and external showcases. We are more than an ensemble creating beautiful music together; we are a close-knit family of musicians who constantly work hard to do our best on the performing stage. Besides practising hard at the harp, we also actively organise activities to bring the ensemble together, such as introducing new members to the family, and showing our love and gratitude for the seniors.
