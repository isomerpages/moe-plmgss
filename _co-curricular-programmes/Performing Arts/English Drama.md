The English Drama Club consists of vibrant, quirky and passionate people who love to express themselves. Training sessions are always filled with creative energy as the actors develop their voice and stage presence for performance.&nbsp; It is also a CCA that helps build strength of character and resilience as the actors take on many roles and interact with each other through various theatre techniques and processes.&nbsp;
