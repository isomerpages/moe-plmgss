<p>2024 has been an enriching year for the PL Concert Band. From perfecting
our craft for concerts like Musical Montage and the PL National Day Parade,
to enjoying memorable bonding activities and the Sec 4 Farewell, we have
had many rewarding moments. We’re especially inspired by our motivated
and hardworking Sec 1 members who have joined the Junior Band. Though rehearsals
can be demanding, the joy of hearing beautiful music come alive through
the synergy of woodwinds, brass and percussion makes every effort worthwhile.
We cherish these shared experiences and look forward to creating more wonderful
musical memories in 2024 and 2025!</p>
