The Handbell Ensemble is a unique performing art group where each member is responsible for ringing her assigned bells for some particular notes in a piece of music. The harmonious chimes of handbells are the result of an intimate collaboration and concerted effort among all members.&nbsp; Each ringer is an integral part of the Handbell Ensemble and significantly contributes to the enjoyment and success of a music making.  
  
The PL Handbell Ensemble was formed in 1987. It was named Daisybells - in honour and remembrance of the late Mrs Daisy Pang who donated the bells. From a humble set of 3 octaves of bells, we have since grown and now boost a set of 6 octaves of bells and 4 octaves of chimes.
