<p>Handbells, a unique instrument from the percussion family, form the heart
of the PL Handbell Ensemble, where each member is responsible for ringing
specific notes in a piece, often switching quickly between bells. This
setup requires exceptional coordination and teamwork for a harmonious performance.
Known for their bright, clear tones, handbells add a versatile charm to
various musical genres. Established in 1987 and named "Daisybells" in memory
of the late Mrs. Daisy Pang, who generously donated the bells, the ensemble
began with just three octaves. Today, it has expanded impressively to include
two sets of six-octave bells, three sets of four-octave chimes, and one
set of bass chimes.</p>
<p><strong>Vision</strong> 
<br>To develop in each member an excellent mind set and team spirit through
the learning of music.</p>
<p><strong>Mission</strong> 
<br>We Ring to the Glory of His Name.</p>
