**CCA – MISSION**  
  
The CCA programme seeks to:  

*   teach pupils skills
*   inculcate correct values and desirable social attitudes
*   provide for healthy recreation

  
This, together with the formal curriculum, will result in a holistic development of our students to cater to the Desired Outcomes of Education  
  
**CCA - PROGRAMME OBJECTIVES**  
  
The CCA Programme provides our girls with a platform to discover their interests and talents. They will develop and demonstrate the following:  

*   passion
*   leadership and teamwork
*   friendship and a sense of belonging
*   spirit of service to the community
*   knowledge, skills and values related to the students’ chosen CCA

Core values, social and emotional competencies and the emerging 21st century competencies as articulated in MOE’s 21st Century Competencies Framework  
  
More specifically,  

*   The Physical Sports develop robustness, fair play and team spirit in students
*   The Visual and Performing Arts instil in students a sense of graciousness and an appreciation for the rich culture and heritage of a multi-racial society
*   The Uniformed Groups develop students into good citizens by inculcating in them self-reliance, resilience, discipline and a spirit of service to others
*   The Clubs and Societies allow students to explore and extend their interests in wide-ranging and specialised areas which may be knowledge-based or skills-based
