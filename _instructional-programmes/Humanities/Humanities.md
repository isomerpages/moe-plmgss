<p>In PLMGS, the Humanities department develops students through Inquiry-Based
Learning. In History, students are exposed to Singapore’s past and the
forces that shaped international History and helps students gain the skills
and knowledge necessary to be critical thinkers and responsible citizens
by learning how to evaluate the information they encounter and question
its source and reliability. In Geography students, are exposed to issues
affecting environment and people’s lives now and in the future. In Social
Studies, we seek to ignite student’s curiosity to inquire about the real
world issues that impact their lives. Through inquiry and authentic learning
experiences, Social Studies helps students to attain relevant knowledge
and understanding about these issues, develop critical and reflective thinking
skills, and appreciate multiple perspectives.</p>
