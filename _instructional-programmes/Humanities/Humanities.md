In PLMGS, the Humanities department develops students through Inquiry-Based Learning. In History, students are exposed to Singapore’s past and the forces that shaped international History and helps students gain the skills and knowledge necessary to be critical thinkers and responsible citizens by learning how to evaluate the information they encounter and question its source and reliability. In Geography students, are exposed to issues affecting environment and people’s lives now and in the future. In Social Studies, we seek to ignite student’s curiosity to inquire about the real world issues that impact their lives. Through inquiry and authentic learning experiences, Social Studies helps students to attain relevant knowledge and understanding about these issues, develop critical and reflective thinking skills, and appreciate multiple perspectives.
