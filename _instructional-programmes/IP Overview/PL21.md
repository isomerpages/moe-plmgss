The PL21 Programme is an integrated and engaging instructional programme to enhance the development of the following 21st Century competencies (21CC) in our students:

*   Critical and Creative thinking  
    
*   Information, Communication and Technology skills  
    
*   Civic Literacy, Global Awareness and Cross-Cultural skills  
    
*   Collaboration skills  
    

  

All lower secondary students will have the opportunity to work on various projects which will build their 21CC while being anchored in disciplinary understanding. Through collaboration and group work, students will develop the PL Desired Outcomes of being a Passionate Learner and Confident PL-Lite whilst demonstrating PLâ€™s 21st Century Skills (the 4Cs) of Creativity and Innovation, Critical Thinking, Confidence and Collaboration.

  

At each level, students will be given different learning opportunities through exposure to different projects in their various subjects, where 21st Century Skills will be developed and reinforced over the 2-year programme.
