### 2023 Assessment for students in Sec 1, 2 and 3 Exp/NA/NT  

1.  Assessment in the form of class assignments, tests and examinations are planned with the intent to enable your daughter/ward to evaluate and chart her learning progress in consultation with her teachers. These marks will be used for promotion at the end of the year. It will also enable the teachers to provide targeted assistance to strengthen her learning.
      
    
2.  The assessment for students in the Sec 1, 2 and 3 level will include Termly Weighted Assessments (WAs) as well as one End-of-Year (EOY) Examination.
      
    
3.  The weighting for the WAs and the EOY Examinations is as follows:

<style type="text/css">
.tg  {border-collapse:collapse;border-spacing:0;}
.tg td{border-color:black;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;
  overflow:hidden;padding:10px 5px;word-break:normal;}
.tg th{border-color:black;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;
  font-weight:normal;overflow:hidden;padding:10px 5px;word-break:normal;}
.tg .tg-2fwu{background-color:#FFF;color:#454545;font-weight:bold;text-align:center;vertical-align:top}
</style>
<table class="tg">
<thead>
  <tr>
    <th class="tg-2fwu">Term 1 WA<br>(1 WA through Alternative Assessment or test)</th>
    <th class="tg-2fwu">Term 2 WA<br> (1 WA through Alternative Assessment or test)</th>
    <th class="tg-2fwu">Term 3 WA<br> (1 WA through Alternative Assessment or test)</th>
    <th class="tg-2fwu">EOY Exam in Term 4</th>
  </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td class="tg-2fwu">10%</td>
    <td class="tg-2fwu">15%</td>
    <td class="tg-2fwu">15%</td>
    <td class="tg-2fwu">60%</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

4. Please note that assessment for some subjects will be conducted as **class tests or coursework.** For subjects such as Design & Technology (D&T) and Food & Consumer Education (FCE), there will not be any EOY Examinations for these two subjects. Hence, their assessment weighting will be:

<style type="text/css">
.tg  {border-collapse:collapse;border-spacing:0;}
.tg td{border-color:black;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;
  overflow:hidden;padding:10px 5px;word-break:normal;}
.tg th{border-color:black;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;
  font-weight:normal;overflow:hidden;padding:10px 5px;word-break:normal;}
.tg .tg-2fwu{background-color:#FFF;color:#454545;font-weight:bold;text-align:center;vertical-align:top}
</style>
<table class="tg">
<thead>
  <tr>
    <th class="tg-2fwu">Term 1 WA<br> <br>-</th>
    <th class="tg-2fwu">Term 2 WA<br>Weighted<br>Assessment</th>
    <th class="tg-2fwu">Term 3 WA<br>Weighted<br>Assessment</th>
    <th class="tg-2fwu">Term 4 EOY<br>Weighted<br>Assessment / Coursework</th>
  </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td class="tg-2fwu">0%</td>
    <td class="tg-2fwu">15%</td>
    <td class="tg-2fwu">15%</td>
    <td class="tg-2fwu">70%</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>

5. Assessments in non-Tamil Indian Languages (e.g. Punjabi) and Foreign Languages are conducted at the MOE Language Centres. An overall grade will be given by the Centres and this grade will be taken as the student’s EOY Examinations result.

6. The school will conduct WAs continuously in Term 1 & 2 for students. This will minimise disruption to curriculum, CCAs and other school related enrichment activities. Please help us to ensure that your daughter/ward revises her work consistently and is prepared for the various assessments.

7. After the tests/examinations, the assessment paper will be returned to your daughter/ward. Please ensure that she keeps you informed of her performance by showing you the assessment papers.  
      
    
8. Should a student be absent on the day of the Weighted Assessment or Examination, she will need to provide a **valid Medical Certificate** (i.e. certified unfit for test/exam). An MC that is issued by a Chinese Physician is **INVALID.** A letter of excuse from parent is **INVALID.** She will be allowed to take the test on the day she is back in school if she has a valid **Medical Certificate**. The make-up test will be conducted at **2.45 p.m. / 3.15 p.m.** in the Science Laboratory. If the student is absent during Examinations, there will be **no retaking of the exam papers**. For more detailed Examination Matters, please refer to the PL Diary.  
      
    
9. Parents/Guardians should ensure that their daughters/wards attend school regularly. Students will not be allowed to take her Examinations at the end of the year if her attendance falls below 80%and is absent without valid reasons.
