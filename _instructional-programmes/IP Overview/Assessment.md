### 2024 Assessment for students in Sec 1, 2 and 3 G3~Exp/G2~NA/G1~NT  

- Assessment in the form of class assignments, tests and examinations are planned with the intent to enable your daughter/ward to evaluate and chart her learning progress in consultation with her teachers. These marks will be used for promotion at the end of the year. It will also enable the teachers to provide targeted assistance to strengthen her learning.

- The assessment for students in the Sec 1, 2 and 3 level will include Termly Weighted Assessments (WAs) as well as one End-of-Year (EOY) Examination.

- The weighting for the WAs and the EOY Examinations is as follows:

<style type="text/css">

.tg td{border-color:black;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;

</style>
<table class="tg">

    <th class="tg-2fwu">Term 2 WA<br> (1 WA through Alternative Assessment or test)</th>
    <th class="tg-2fwu">Term 3 WA<br> (1 WA through Alternative Assessment or test)</th>

    <td class="tg-2fwu">60%</td>

- Please note that assessment for some subjects will be conducted as **class tests or coursework.** For subjects such as Design &amp; Technology (D&amp;T) and Food &amp; Consumer Education (FCE), there will not be any EOY Examinations for these two subjects. Hence, their assessment weighting will be:

<style type="text/css">
.tg  {border-collapse:collapse;border-spacing:0;}
.tg td{border-color:black;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;

- Assessments in non-Tamil Indian Languages (e.g. Punjabi) and Foreign Languages are conducted at the MOE Language Centres. An overall grade will be given by the Centres and this grade will be taken as the student’s EOY Examinations result.

- The school will conduct WAs continuously in Term 1 - 3 for students. This will minimise disruption to curriculum, CCAs and other school related enrichment activities. Please help us to ensure that your daughter/ward revises her work consistently and is prepared for the various assessments.

- Students will receive their assessment feedback once the grading is completed. Students will discuss and review the feedback and learning in class with their teachers. Students are encouraged to share their learning and performance with their parents/guardians. Parents/Guardians will receive your daughter/ward’s Term Result Slip at the start of the following term. 

- For WAs - Should a student be absent on the day of WA, she will need to provide a&nbsp;valid Medical Certificate*. She will receive the assessment papers for self timed-practice and ‘MC’ status will be indicated for the paper. (*Noted that: An MC that is issued by a Chinese Physician and letter of excuse from parent are&nbsp;INVALID). 

- For Exam - Should a student be absent on the day of exam paper, she will need to provide a&nbsp;valid Medical Certificate, a ‘MC’ status will be indicated for the paper. A student who is absent from an examination without a MC will get an ‘AB’ status (equivalent to zero mark attainment).

- Parents/Guardians should ensure that their daughters/wards attend school regularly. Students will not be allowed to take her Examinations at the end of the year if her attendance&nbsp;falls below 80% and is absent without valid reasons.
