### Definition of Homework

Homework refers to any learning activity that students are required by the school to complete outside of curriculum time. This includes assignments and projects but not revision of school work or studying for tests and examinations.

  

##### Objectives of Homework

*   Homework can reinforce students’ learning, provide feedback on their progress and cultivate a healthy disposition towards learning.  It helps to reinforce learning and deepen understanding of lessons taught; allow students to regularly practise, and apply skills and concepts taught; develop good study skills and habits; and encourage greater ownership and responsibility for independent learning.  
    
*   Homework also provides parents with timely information on the progress of their child’s learning; and opportunity to be involved in the child’s learning.
    

  

##### Principles for assigning homework

*   Homework set has strong emphasis on the development of core skills and knowledge taught in class.  
    
*   Differentiated assignments are set based on students’ needs and abilities.
    

  

##### Frequency of homework

*   In general, students would have an average of 4 to 6 assignments per week. The duration for the completion of each piece of homework would be between 30 and 50 minutes of focused attention per assignment. The homework policy statement would be refined to not more than 2 assignments per subject per week.  
    
*   Short assignments may be required to be submitted the following lesson / week.  Longer assignments may take up more than a month to complete.  
    
*   Timely and useful feedback will be provided to maximise students’ learning.  This may be via teacher, peer, self-marked assignments or classroom instruction and discussions building upon the completed homework (e.g. presentation by students).
