### PL 21 Resources for students

The PL 21 programme is a 2-year programme for Sec 1 and Sec 2 PL-Lites developed by our Staff, in alignment to MOE’s Framework for 21st Century Competencies and Student Outcomes. The PL 21 programme seeks to develop in our students the 21st Century Competencies (21CC) necessary for the globalised world we live in. A part of the PL programme involves the explicit teaching of life skills to help nurture a sense of agency within the girls.  
  
These skills are summarized in the following posters as a handy collection of posters for quick reference, whenever the girls need to draw upon what they have learnt.
