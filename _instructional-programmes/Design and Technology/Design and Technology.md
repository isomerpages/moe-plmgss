### Our Vision

A Culture of Designing for Life

  

### Our Mission

To imbue in our students design dispositions that prepares them to embrace uncertainties and complexities in the 21st century

  

The Design and Technology Department seeks to enrich students with life skills that will enable them to think out of the box and be creative problem solver. Students will get to interact with materials that are commonly used in their daily life and be able to appreciate how things around them are designed and created.  
  
Design and Technology employs mainly the design thinking approach through design situations. Students will also be put through a journey of self-discovery and experiential learning. At Secondary 1, students are introduced to skills required to manage materials. They will embark on projects using recycled materials to help them understand the importance of green movement and its sustainability. At Secondary 2, they will put on their critical thinking hats to create prototypes that will help them solve real-world problems and fulfill needs which they have identified.

  

The areas of study include the following:  

*   Sec 1 - Theory: The Design Process, Understanding Materials (Plastic and Wood)
*   Sec 1 - Practical: Basic Techniques of Designing (Doodling, Sketching, Research Work), Realisation of Designed Prototypes (Parting, Bending and Joining of Materials)
*   Sec 2 - Theory:  The Design Thinking Approach (Analysis of Situation, Ideation, Detail Development, Presentation Drawings), Understanding Materials (Metal)
*   Sec 2 - Practical: Problem Solving with focus on discovering needs of people around them  
    

  
Towards the end of the lower secondary Design & Technology program, students will be given the opportunity to submit their prototypes in the following awards  
  

*   Tan Kah Kee Young Inventors’ Award
*   Innovation Program by gifted Education Branch, MOE
*   Design & Technology Award, MOE
*   Design For Change Singapore Challenge (DFC)

  
Aside from the Design & Technology curriculum, the department promotes robotics program to our students who are interested and have an apt for coding and programming through our EE Robotics Program. This will provide the opportunities for them to be exposed to the world of Science, Technolgy, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM). They will be sent to robot building and programming courses. Students shall then be selected to represent PLMGSS in various robotics competitions.
