### Brief History  

Paya Lebar Methodist Girls’ School (Pri & Sec) were appointed as the East Zone Centre of Excellence for the Creative Arts (COECA) in 2008. COECA@PL organises and spearheads performing arts programmes impacting staff and pupils in the East Zone schools. In 2010, the former COEs for Music (Pasir Ris Crest Secondary School) and for Art (Siglap Secondary School) joined the COECA as its Music and Art Satellites respectively. In 2012, Haig Girls’ School was appointed as COECA@Haig with the specific focus on arts education.

The COECA Steering Committee provides direction to the four Working Committees to plan and organise programmes in the areas of Performing Arts, Visual Arts, Music and Arts Education. Mrs Marian Chia, Supt/E5, is the advisor of the COECA, while the position of Chairperson of the Steering Committee is rotated annually amongst the Principals. In 2013, Ms Pamela Yoong, Principal, Paya Lebar Methodist Girls’ School (Sec), was the Chairperson. In 2014, the baton was passed to Ms Chua Soh Leng, Principal, Paya Lebar Methodist Girls' School (Primary).

### Objectives of the Centre 

The vision of the COE is **_Arts Alive!_** The COE hopes to make the arts a living phenomenon in the lives of the students, teachers and the larger community by making the arts accessible to them.  For the students especially, it is hoped that this exposure to the arts would lead to life-long enjoyment of the arts. 

The mission of the COE is to “connect the EZ schools and the Arts Community to Experience, Enjoy and Explore the Creative Arts.”

The objectives are as follows:

*   To enhance the competency of teachers in the East Zone to develop the creative arts in their schools  
    
*   To provide opportunities for pupils to appreciate a variety of performing arts  
    
*   To establish collaborations with the arts community in order to enhance the learning experiences of teachers and pupils, and to stay current with emerging trends in the arts scene
