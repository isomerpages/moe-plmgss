The Music Programme at PLMGS (Sec) aims to develop in students an appreciation for music. Through the Instructional Programme, the students gain an awareness of and appreciation for music of various cultures and the role of music in daily living. They also develop ability for creative expression through music making. We hope the Music Programme at PLMGS (Sec) will provide the basis for students to develop an informed and life-long involvement in music.

  

Music Programme is offered to all students in the lower secondary Express, Normal (Academic) and Normal (Technical). This programme serves as a platform for students to experience music through listening, performing and creating. The modular structure of the Music Programme allows the students to acquire skills in instrumental playing (guitar, orff instrument, handchimes), singing as well as compositional skills (song cover and song writing). We use Experience-Concept-Application (ECA), Kodaly and Orff as our main pedagogical approaches for the learning of music concepts and acquisition of musical understandings.  

  

In addition, we also offer GCE O-Level Music Course to the Secondary 3 and 4 students. With a smaller class size and customised instructional programme, the students will benefit from the interactions with other like-minded peers in the programme. It is a 2-year programme to prepare students for the GCE O-level at the end of Secondary 4. Students will learn about music from different genres such as Jazz, Western Classical and Popular culture. More details of the syllabus can be found here: [https://www.seab.gov.sg/docs/default-source/national-examinations/syllabus/olevel/2020syllabus/6085\_y20\_sy.pdf](https://www.seab.gov.sg/docs/default-source/national-examinations/syllabus/olevel/2020syllabus/6085_y20_sy.pdf)  

  

Some of the enrichment activities organised by the Music Unit include the Arts Assembly Programme, termly Lunchtime Concerts, performance at PL Primary’s Classics in the Canteen and learning journeys to attend concerts.
