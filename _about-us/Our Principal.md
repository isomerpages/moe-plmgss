<h3>Principal’s Message 2024</h3><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width:50%" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/amy_ng2023.jpg"></div><p>Our girls are the future of the nation. The uncertainty of the future can seem daunting at times, yet it is essential to acknowledge the incredible potential within each of our girls.</p><p>At PL, I have seen the Lord’s abundant blessings on the school and our girls. Our girls are God’s gifts, each unique and demonstrate precious qualities. While some may grapple with confidence and self-belief, it is a natural part of growing up, and with the supportive environment we provide, they will undoubtedly overcome these challenges and thrive.</p><p>For over a century, PLMGS has strived to nurture ‘<strong>Confident PL-Lites, Passionate Learners, Active Citizens and Inspiring Leaders</strong>’, young women who can make a difference. I pray and trust that we will continue to learn, strive to be better and stronger versions of ourselves each day. I pray we learn to fix our eyes on God as our ultimate goal, believing that we are more than enough in Him. I pray that all our girls realise that through Him, we are already the “PL-Lite” who can make a difference in this challenging world, beacons in the community.</p><p>The light of God shines through the school and PL serves as the beacon to the community. Our girls are blessed and will be empowered at PL to “shine before men [through their] good works” and bring “Glory to God”. I appeal for everyone – staff, parents, alumni, and most importantly, the girls – to join me to live our School Motto – <em>Look up, Lift up</em> – to look up to God and lift our eyes unto Him who is the source of our strength and hope, as we mould our future through our girls, together by being others-centred and through faith and courage.</p><p>Each child possesses unique talents and strengths. I urge all our girls, our PL-Lites, to make full use of your strengths, potential and talent. <em>Look up, lift up</em> your worries to the Lord, work hard and courageously to solve any problems you come across because you are a special child of God who can make a difference to those around you.&nbsp;</p><p>We will achieve our school’s mission and vision with strong partnership, organisational excellence and our committed staff. I sincerely invite you to partner us, in our dedicated efforts to make a difference to the lives of PL-Lites and their loved ones, believing that all our PL-Lites can <em>SHINE</em> and will be the future of the nation as they bring hope to those around them.</p><p>Yours faithfully,<br>Ms Amy Ng<br>Principal<br>Paya Lebar Methodist Girls’ School (Secondary)</p><p>Do follow us on our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/PAYALEBARMGS/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Facebook page</a>&nbsp;to get constant updates about our school.</p>
