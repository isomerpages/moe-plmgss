2022 Year Theme – Enriched to face life’s greatest call

  
Our 2022 Year Theme – “Enriched to face life’s greatest call” is inspired by the lyrics of our School Anthem

<center>So when we leave its shelt'ring walls<br>  
We go with fearlessness<br>
<b>Enriched to face life's greatest call</b><br>
By Paya Lebar MGS</center>

We have also identified a Theme verse to support and anchor our Theme for the year:  
  

“Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid; do not be discouraged, for the Lord your God will be with you wherever you go.” Joshua 1:9

  
I was overwhelmed and encouraged when the school shared its focus for 2022 with me. Joshua 1:9 has been God’s guiding words for me in my years of service as an educator. Joshua 1:9 has been most meaningful when I first served as Principal from 2015 to 2021, especially during challenging times. I thank the Lord for reminding me of his presence as I start my service as Principal of PLMGS (Secondary). I pray Joshua 1:9 will touch our girls and their families as much as it has anchored me in my life. I pray and trust the Lord will be with me and all our stakeholders – School Board of Management, PL Alumni, staff, students and parents, as we learn and grow together to build God’s school.  

  

PLMGS (Secondary) is a distinctively Christian school with a long tradition of care and excellence. In the last two years amidst the global pandemic, the School Values became even more relevant and significant. These values anchor the work that we do and remind us daily of the character we hope to build in our girls.

We will continue this journey of excellence and care where every student matters. We will strive to continue to bring the best out in all our girls through our efforts in holistic education (moral and spiritual, cognitive, physical, social and emotional, aesthetic), to nurture our girls to become women of fine character with a passion for life and learning.  
  
We will achieve our school’s mission and vision with strong partnership, organisational excellence and our committed staff. I sincerely invite you to partner us in our journey through the year, in our dedicated efforts to make a difference to the lives of PL-Lites and their loved ones.

  

Please join me to live our School Motto – Look up, Lift up – to look up to God and lift our eyes unto Him who is the source of our strength and hope, as we mould our future through our girls, together.  
  
In His service,  <br>
