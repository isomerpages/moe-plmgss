**Theme Song:**         

**Carry Your Candle / Go Light Your World**

There is a candle in every soul  <br>
Some brightly burning, some dark and cold  <br>
There is a Spirit who brings fire  <br>
Ignites a candle and makes His home  
  
Carry your candle, run to the darkness  <br>
Seek out the hopeless, confused and torn  <br>
Hold out your candle for all to see it  <br>
Take your candle, and go light your world <br> 
Take your candle, and go light your world  
  
Frustrated brother, see how he's tried to  <br>
Light his own candle some other way  
  
See now your sister, she's been robbed and lied to  <br>
Still holds a candle without a flame.  
  
Carry your candle, run to the darkness  <br>
Seek out the lonely, the tired and worn  <br>
Hold out your candle for all to see it  <br>
Take your candle, and go light your world  <br>
Take your candle, and go light your world  
  
We are a family whose hearts are blazing  <br>
So let's raise our candles and light up the sky  <br>
Praying to our Father, in the name of Jesus  <br>
Make us a beacon in darkest times  
  
Carry your candle, run to the darkness  <br>
Seek out the helpless, deceived and poor  <br>
Hold out your candle for all to see it  <br>
Take your candle, and go light your world  
  
Carry your candle, run to the darkness  <br>
Seek out the hopeless, confused and torn  <br>
Hold out your candle for all to see it  <br>
Take your candle, and go light your world  <br>
Take your candle, and go light your world  
  

  

**2022 Monthly Themes**  
  

These Monthly themes provide the focus for our morning devotions and monthly school-wide programmes. They serve to anchor the interactions that staff and PL-Lites would have thoughout each month. They seek to build up a positive growth culture in our school and lead the fraternity to live out our school value of ‘Thankfulness’ daily.
