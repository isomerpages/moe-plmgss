**Shine Jesus Shine**

Lord, the light of Your love is shining  
In the midst of the darkness, shining  
Jesus, Light of the world, shine upon us  
Set us free by the truth You now bring us  
Shine on me, shine on meShine, Jesus, shine  
Fill this land with the Father's glory  
Blaze, Spirit, blaze  
Set our hearts on fire  
Flow, river, flow  
Flood the nations with grace and mercy  
Send forth Your word  
Lord, and let there be light  
  
Lord, I come to Your awesome presence  
From the shadows into Your radiance  
By the blood I may enter Your brightness  
Search me, try me, consume all my darkness  
Shine on me, shine on me  
  
Shine, Jesus, shine  
Fill this land with the Father's glory  
Blaze, Spirit, blaze  
Set our hearts on fire  
Flow, river, flow  
Flood the nations with grace and mercy  
Send forth Your word  
Lord, and let there be light  
  
As we gaze on Your kingly brightness  
So our faces display Your likeness  
Ever changing from glory to glory  
Mirrored here may our lives tell Your story  
Shine on me, shine on me  
  
Shine, Jesus, shine  
Fill this land with the Father's glory  
Blaze, Spirit, blaze  
Set our hearts on fire  
Flow, river, flow  
Flood the nations with grace and mercy  
Send forth Your word  
Lord, and let there be light
