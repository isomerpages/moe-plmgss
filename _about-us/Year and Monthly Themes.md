![](/images/theme2024.jpg)


**PLMGS Age:** 108th year  
  
**2024 Year Theme:** Be True, Pure, Strong and Brave
  
****2024 School Theme and Theme Verse****  

_“Finally, brothers and sisters, whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, 
whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable 
– if anything is excellent or praiseworthy – think about such things.”
	Philippians 4:8 [NIV]_
  
**Inspiration:**<br>
Inspired by Our **School Creed**<br>
Stanza 1<br>
*I would be true for there are those who trust me<br>
I would be pure for there are those who care<br>
I would be strong for there is much to suffer<br>
I would be brave for there is much to dare.*



**Theme Song:**<br>
**Little by Little**

Lyrics:<br>
Little by little everyday<br>
Little by little in every way<br>
Jesus is changing me,<br>
He's changing me.<br>
Since I made that turn about face<br>
I've been growing in His grace<br>
Jesus is changing me.<br>

He's changing me, my precious Saviour<br>
I'm not the same person that I used to be<br>
Well, it's been slow going<br>
But still there's knowing<br>
That someday perfect I will be. ......
