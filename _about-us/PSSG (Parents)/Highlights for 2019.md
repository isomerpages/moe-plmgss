On the sunny morning of 19 October, 120 parents and their families, international students and PL staff all geared up for our very first PL Amazing Race at Sentosa! Besides racing round the island to get to the various check-points, they soaked in the sights and sounds of Sentosa. It was a morning filled with fun, laughter and sweat, bonding with the PL family!
