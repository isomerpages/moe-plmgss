Ms Sarojini Devi and Mrs Indra Vasu, daughters of the late Mr S Thiagarajan, an old boy of our school, then known as Paya Lebar English School, donated an award in his memory. The Thiagarajan Award will be awarded to Top 2 performing PL (Pri) Primary 6 girls who have moved on to PL (Sec) in the Normal (Academic) Stream.Â 


Both Ms Sarojini Devi and Mrs Indra Vasu were old girls of the school. Mrs Vasu taught in PL as an Art teacher in the 1990s. The Thiagarajan Award will be given at the PL100 Founder's Day. PL Primary, PL Secondary and Alumni would like to thank Ms Devi and Mrs Vasu for their generous contribution as well as their continued love for PL.

Thank you for making a difference.
