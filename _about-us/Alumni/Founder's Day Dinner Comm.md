Each year, the Alumni hosts the school’s Founder’s Day Dinner. A sub-committee is created for the purposes of overseeing the organisation and preparations for this important event in our alma mater’s calendar. If you are interested in helping out, do email us at [justshine@plmgsalumni.sg](mailto:justshine@plmgsalumni.sg).
