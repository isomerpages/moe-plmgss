<p><strong>PLMGS Age:</strong>&nbsp;110th year
<br><strong>2026 Year Theme:</strong>&nbsp;One Perfect 10 in Christ
<br><strong>2026 Theme Verse:</strong>
<br><em>"Just as a body, though one, has many parts, but all its many parts form one body, so it is with Christ." <br>- 1 Corinthians 12:12</em>
</p>
<p><strong>Inspiration:</strong>
<br>In an increasingly diverse society and world, we call for “more we” and
“less me”. We are stronger together, supporting one another despite our
differences. We also look to Jesus Christ as the unifying force and strength.
<br>
<br>Verse 4 of our Theme song “<em>We Are One</em>” aptly captures what we
hope to achieve as a school.</p>
<p>[Verse 4]
<br>Shaped by the hands of the potter
<br>No two pieces alike
<br>When we build a shelter together
<br><em>We will shine, we will shine</em>
</p>
<p>[Chorus]
<br>Let us draw near to each other
<br>We are one, we are one
<br>We are all sisters and brothers
<br>Telling stories of our Father's love</p>

<p>Lyrics:
<br>[Chorus]
<br>Let us draw near to each other,
<br>We are one, We are one
<br>We are all sisters and brothers
<br>Telling stories of our Father's love<em> [before Verse 1]</em>
<br><em>At the feast of our Father's love [after Verse 1]</em>
<br><em>Living free in our Father's love [after Verse 2]</em>
<br><em>Warming hands by the fire of His love [after Verse 3]</em>
</p>
<p>[Verse 1]
<br>You've got a place at the table,
<br>A family where you belong
<br>So, open your arms if you're able,
<br>Welcome home! Welcome home! [Chorus]</p>
<p>[Verse 2]
<br>We can come weary and burdened,
<br>With the weight of the world on our backs
<br>We can hand it all over to Jesus,
<br>Find our rest, find our rest [Chorus]</p>
<p>[Verse 3]
<br>Travellers, misfits, and exiles,
<br>Don't grow cold in the dark of night
<br>Gather for hope and for comfort,
<br>In His light, in His light [Chorus]</p>
<p>We are one, one, one, By His love, love, love [2X]</p>
<p>Shaped by the hands of the potter,
<br>No two pieces alike
<br>When we build a shelter together,
<br>We will shine, we will shine&nbsp; [Chorus 2X]
<br>We'll tell the stories of our Father's love [2X]</p>
