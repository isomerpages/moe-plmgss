<p>Stanza 2
<br>I would be <strong>friend of all</strong>, the foe, the friendless&nbsp;
<br>I would be giving and forget the gift
<br>I would be humble for I know my weakness

<p>Lyrics:
<br>A friend loves at all times
<br>Jesus is a friend of mine
<br>Laying down his life
<br>A friend loves at all times
<br>
<br>Underneath the stars at night
<br>When the sun shines so bright
<br>When we jump and when we fall
<br>Jesus loves us all
<br>‘Cause he’s the perfect friend
<br>
<br>Oh, a friend loves at all times</p>
