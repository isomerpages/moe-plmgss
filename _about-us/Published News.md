The EZ Beacon is a publication which showcases the programmes and initiatives of schools in the East Zone (EZ). Through sharing the good stories and practices in EZ schools, we hope to deepen the culture of collaboration amongst schools, share the impact school experiences have on students, staff and stakeholders, and provide the public with developments in the school scene.  
  
This volume captures good stories of how school promotes Joyful Learning. Read PL’s stories here:

On 8 February 2017, our girls were given the opportunity to learn the traditional method (using coals) of making love letters at PL Secondary. We would like to thank all parents who laboured over the coals while guiding our girls in the love letters making process. We love the smell, the taste, the feel and the joy of celebrating CNY as a family.
