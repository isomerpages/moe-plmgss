On 8 February 2017, our girls were given the opportunity to learn the traditional method (using coals) of making love letters at PL Secondary. We would like to thank all parents who laboured over the coals while guiding our girls in the love letters making process. We love the smell, the taste, the feel and the joy of celebrating CNY as a family.

On 4 March 2014, the Lianhe Wanbao carried a report on an anonymous Nanyang Junior College (NYJC) student who gave teachers and students a treat at the canteen drinks stall accompanied by 32 handwritten notes in November 2013. She was an alumni PL-Lite, Miss Keely New (Sec 4A1, Class of 2011). The report noted comments from Principal ofNYJC who said he had wanted to reveal the girl’s name when the A Levels results were distributed yesterday. However, he kept it as a secret to surprise his staff and students. &nbsp;The Principal of NYJC also said he would share this through the school’s official Facebook page as there were still many who were unaware of the girl’s identity. Keely was well-liked by both teachers and her peers in school and was awarded the Edusave Character Award in August 2013.

### 2013

**Undaunted by disability**

![](/images/chia_yong_yong_sm.jpg)

<small>(Source: The Straits Times © Singapore Press Holdings Limited. Reproduced with permission)</small>

  

The school congratulates Ms Chia Yong Yong (PL Alumni, 1969-1978) on her appointment as Nominated Member of Parliament in September 2014. The first physically disabled parliamentarian in Singapore, Ms Chia will serve a two and a half year term.

In an interview with the Straits Times, she recounted her days as a student in PLMGS.

She started tripping and falling in kindergarten, but was diagnosed &nbsp;with peroneal muscular atrophy only at 15. As her muscle tissue progressively weakened, she used crutches, then a wheelchair. She has not been able to stand for more than 20 years and her hands have grown limp and curled as well.

  

Her alma mater, Paya Lebar Methodist &nbsp;Girls' School, worked &nbsp;around her mobility issues &nbsp;- yet treated her as normally as possible. Her former secondary school principal, Mrs Winnie Tan, gave her ground-floor classrooms.&nbsp;

  

Friends helped her to the laboratory and chapel on the second floor, exemplifying the school's ethos as a "household of love and faith", Mrs Tan says.&nbsp;

  

Ms Chia says: "If I was too talkative, I would be made to stand up. The teachers didn't treat me differently."

  

She is a lawyer at Yusarn Audrey Law Firm and she has been President of the Society for the Physically Disabled since 2008.&nbsp;

  

In 2011, she was awarded the President’s Social Service Award, by the President of the Republic of Singapore for voluntary contributions made to the social service sector.&nbsp;

In 2013, she was awarded the Public Service Medal (PBM) in the National Day Awards in recognition of her exemplary service rendered to Singapore.

  

### Alumni PL-Lite wins Photography Award

### SSO on Campus

![](/images/sso_cover2013.jpeg)

Rhapssody is a quarterly Community Outreach Newsletter published by the Singapore Symphony Orchestra. In the Sep-Dec 2013 issue, there was article on SSO on Campus which featured PLMGS (Sec). Below is an excerpt of the article.

Each school was actively involved in every stage of the process, from preparations to publicity to execution of the concert proper, and distributing concert flyers both internally and externally, promoting the concert during school assemblies and deploying student ushers to assist the SSO with audience management. They see this partnership as beneficial to both the community and the school.&nbsp;

As Mr Ng Eng Kee, Aesthetics Subject Head of PLMGS (S) shares: "One of the school's strategic thrusts is Partnership, and the collaboration between the SSO and PLMGS (S) is a recognition of our school's effort in arts education. The outreach concert makes the school more accessible to the community and helps to raise public awareness of the school and its strength and focus on the arts. It provides an opportunity for the community to witness and appreciate high quality music making in the heartland of Lorong AhSoo and close to their home.&nbsp;

The concert might be the first time some of the pupils are exposed to classical symphonic music. For those pupils with some exposure to orchestral concerts, the campus performances provide an added avenue through which the professional musicians inspire them."
