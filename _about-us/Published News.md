On 8 February 2017, our girls were given the opportunity to learn the traditional method (using coals) of making love letters at PL Secondary. We would like to thank all parents who laboured over the coals while guiding our girls in the love letters making process. We love the smell, the taste, the feel and the joy of celebrating CNY as a family.

On 4 March 2014, the Lianhe Wanbao carried a report on an anonymous Nanyang Junior College (NYJC) student who gave teachers and students a treat at the canteen drinks stall accompanied by 32 handwritten notes in November 2013. She was an alumni PL-Lite, Miss Keely New (Sec 4A1, Class of 2011). The report noted comments from Principal ofNYJC who said he had wanted to reveal the girl’s name when the A Levels results were distributed yesterday. However, he kept it as a secret to surprise his staff and students.  The Principal of NYJC also said he would share this through the school’s official Facebook page as there were still many who were unaware of the girl’s identity. Keely was well-liked by both teachers and her peers in school and was awarded the Edusave Character Award in August 2013.

### 2013

**Undaunted by disability**

The school congratulates Ms Chia Yong Yong (PL Alumni, 1969-1978) on her appointment as Nominated Member of Parliament in September 2014. The first physically disabled parliamentarian in Singapore, Ms Chia will serve a two and a half year term.

In an interview with the Straits Times, she recounted her days as a student in PLMGS.

She started tripping and falling in kindergarten, but was diagnosed  with peroneal muscular atrophy only at 15. As her muscle tissue progressively weakened, she used crutches, then a wheelchair. She has not been able to stand for more than 20 years and her hands have grown limp and curled as well.

  

Her alma mater, Paya Lebar Methodist  Girls' School, worked  around her mobility issues  - yet treated her as normally as possible. Her former secondary school principal, Mrs Winnie Tan, gave her ground-floor classrooms. 

  

Friends helped her to the laboratory and chapel on the second floor, exemplifying the school's ethos as a "household of love and faith", Mrs Tan says. 

  

Ms Chia says: "If I was too talkative, I would be made to stand up. The teachers didn't treat me differently."

  

She is a lawyer at Yusarn Audrey Law Firm and she has been President of the Society for the Physically Disabled since 2008. 

  

In 2011, she was awarded the President’s Social Service Award, by the President of the Republic of Singapore for voluntary contributions made to the social service sector. 

In 2013, she was awarded the Public Service Medal (PBM) in the National Day Awards in recognition of her exemplary service rendered to Singapore.
