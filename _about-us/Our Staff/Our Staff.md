<p>A team of highly competent, motivated and committed staff, of which 68%
are Christians, have shaped PL and made her what she is today - a school
with a good academic track record and high standards of discipline and
morals.</p>
<p>Many old girls, inspired by the love and commitment of their teachers,
have also come back to serve in their Alma Mater. We place our pupils in
good and loving hands that will bring out the best in them.</p>
<p>To support our Instructional Programme and Co-curricular Programme, we
have a core pool of professionals supporting the teachers. This pool includes
the Allied Educators and Administrative Staff. To better meet the needs
of our pupils, our staff are trained through relevant local and overseas
programmes.</p>
