A team of highly competent, motivated and committed staff, of which 68% are Christians, have shaped PL and made her what she is today - a school with a good academic track record and high standards of discipline and morals.  
  
Many old girls, inspired by the love and commitment of their teachers, have also come back to serve in their Alma Mater. We place our pupils in good and loving hands that will bring out the best in them.  
  
To support our Instructional Programme and Co-curricular Programme, we have a core pool of professionals supporting the teachers. This pool includes the Allied Educators and Administrative Staff. To better meet the needs of our pupils, our staff are trained through relevant local and overseas programmes.
