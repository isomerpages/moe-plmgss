For direct admission into a secondary school via the DSA-Sec Exercise, the school will select students based on their talents in non-academic areas. To assess these qualities, the school will conduct trials and interviews as necessary. DSA applicants successfully admitted to the school through the DSA-Sec Exercise will not need to make any school choices during the Sec 1 Posting Exercise.

### PLMGS(Sec) Direct School Admission (DSA-Sec)

Paya Lebar Methodist Girls’ School (Secondary) is a school with a family culture, anchored on Christian beliefs and values. We believe in providing a holistic education for all our students and stretching each one to their fullest potential. Besides a strong academic programme with value-added results for both our Express and Normal Streams, we also have a vibrant culture of Music, Arts and Sports. If you embrace these beliefs and values, we invite you to join our family.  
  
In view of the current low risk environment, students will be allowed to travel to PLMGS (Sec) for in-person selection as students will be better able to demonstrate their talents. Strict safe management measures (SMM) guidelines will be put in place to ensure the safety of students and staff. Additional SMM will be put in place for Sports and Games as well as Performing Arts to manage the higher risk levels. Please be informed e-modes (e.g. video conferencing) will not be used this year. We may reschedule in-person selection or convert in-person selection to e-mode (on an exceptional case by case basis) for students who test COVID-19 positive during the selection period.  
  
Please watch this space for further updates on the safe management principles to ensure safety of students and staff.  
  
The Direct School Admission (DSA-Sec) selection criteria for PLMGS (Sec) are listed in the table below.
