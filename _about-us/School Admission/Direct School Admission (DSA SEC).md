For direct admission into a secondary school via the DSA-Sec Exercise, the school will select students based on their talents in non-academic areas. To assess these qualities, the school will conduct trials and interviews as necessary. DSA applicants successfully admitted to the school through the DSA-Sec Exercise will not need to make any school choices during the Sec 1 Posting Exercise.
