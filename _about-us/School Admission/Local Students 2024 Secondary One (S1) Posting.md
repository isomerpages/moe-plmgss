<p>The Secondary 1 Option Exercise will be conducted for all PSLE candidates
immediately after the release of the PSLE results in late November. Students
will be posted into secondary schools in December based on merit, choice
and places available in the school.</p>
<h4><strong>Students from PLMGS (Primary)</strong></h4>
<p>If a child is studying in PLMGS (Primary) and wants to continue secondary
education in the affiliated secondary school, PLMGS (Secondary), she must
indicate PLMGS (Secondary) as the first-choice school, to enjoy priority
for admission to the affiliated secondary school. There is an Affiliate
Minimum Requirement for PLMGS (Primary) students for admission to Posting
Group 3. However, being accorded priority for admission does not guarantee
admission to PLMGS (Secondary), as it is subject to availability of places.
Depending on the demand and choice patterns of that year, if there is more
demand from eligible affiliates than the available places at Secondary
One Posting, posting in of affiliates will be based on their PSLE AL scores.
This may result in some affiliates not being admitted despite meeting the
Affiliate Minimum Requirement.</p>
<h4><strong>Students from Other Primary Schools</strong></h4>
<p>Starting from 2020, there will be at least 20% in each Posting Group set
aside for non-affiliated students.</p>
