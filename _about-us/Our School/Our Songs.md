<p>O let our youthful voices ring
<br>With all their joyfulness
<br>In praise and gladness let us sing
<br>Of Paya Lebar MGS (2*)</p>
<p>Here we may seek all wisdom, truth
<br>And ways of kindliness
<br>Through all the years of golden youth
<br>At Paya Lebar MGS (2*)</p>
<p>So when we leave its shelt'ring walls
<br>We go with fearlessness
<br>Enriched to face life's greatest call
<br>By Paya Lebar MGS (2*)</p>
<p>Lord bless our school our dear PLMGS
<br>With peace and love and joy and grace
<br>Our PL-Lites we send to lead and bless
<br>From Paya Lebar MGS (2*)</p>
<p>(This new Stanza is written for PL100 by Mrs Winnie Tan,&nbsp;
<br>Principal 1972-1997)</p>
<p>Now let us pray and learn and trust and obey
<br>To serve Him in every way
<br>Glory to God we give and pray
<br>For Paya Lebar MGS (2*)</p>

<p>Our school is the place I love the best
<br>For our school isn't like all the rest
<br>For our love makes something special
<br>Out of our school everyday</p>
<p>At our school we are taught to obey
<br>And our school is a church where we pray
<br>For God's love makes something special
<br>Out of our school everyday</p>
<p>And Chapels every Wednesday
<br>Are best of all to me
<br>For we are all together
<br>Just the way we like to be</p>
<p>Yes our school is filled with laughter and play
<br>And our school is where I want to stay
<br>For our love makes something special
<br>Out of our school everyday</p>
<p>For our love makes something special
<br>Out of PL everyday</p>

<p>A friend loves at all times
<br>Jesus is a friend of mine
<br>Laying down his life
<br>A friend loves at all times
<br>
<br>Underneath the stars at night
<br>When the sun shines so bright
<br>When we jump and when we fall
<br>Jesus loves us all
<br>‘Cause he’s the perfect friend
<br>
<br>Oh, a friend loves at all times</p>

<p>I hear the bells of PL ring
<br>The notes of golden youth;
<br>I hear His voice in every peal
<br>Calling me to seek the Truth
<br>I hear, and seek to make my life
<br>A mirror of His shining light,
<br>Do the chimes stir within your heart
<br>His awesome peace and might?</p>
<p>Let your light so shine before men
<br>That all may see His face;
<br>Let our school be a torch aflame
<br>Teaching love and His saving grace.</p>
<p>I hear the pipes of PL sound
<br>The Majesty of God.
<br>I hear the songs we sing in praise,
<br>Lifting His name with one accord,
<br>O PL girls make Him as our Lord;
<br>Let us enthrone Him as our King.
<br>Our God has promised those who trust
<br>His loving care and blessing.</p>
<h3>School Creed</h3>
<p>I would be true for there are those who trust me&nbsp;
<br>I would be pure for there are those who care
<br>I would be strong for there is much to suffer
<br>I would be brave for there is much to dare.</p>
<p>I would be friend of all, the foe, the friendless&nbsp;
<br>I would be giving and forget the gift
<br>I would be humble for I know my weakness
<br>I would look up and love and laugh and lift.</p>
<p>I would be prayerful through each busy moment&nbsp;
<br>I would be constantly in touch with God
<br>I would be tuned to hear His slightest whisper
<br>I would have faith to tread the path Christ trod.</p>
