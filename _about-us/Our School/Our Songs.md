O let our youthful voices ring <br>
With all their joyfulness <br>
In praise and gladness let us sing <br>
Of Paya Lebar MGS (2*)

  

Here we may seek all wisdom, truth <br>
And ways of kindliness <br>
Through all the years of golden youth <br>
At Paya Lebar MGS (2*)

  

So when we leave its shelt'ring walls <br>
We go with fearlessness <br>
Enriched to face life's greatest call <br>
By Paya Lebar MGS (2*)

  

Lord bless our school our dear PLMGS <br>
With peace and love and joy and grace <br>
Our PL-Lites we send to lead and bless <br>
From Paya Lebar MGS (2*)

(This new Stanza is written for PL100 by Mrs Winnie Tan,&nbsp; <br>
Principal 1972-1997)

  

Now let us pray and learn and trust and obey <br>
To serve Him in every way <br>
Glory to God we give and pray <br>
For Paya Lebar MGS (2*)

Our school is the place I love the best <br>
For our school isn't like all the rest <br>
For our love makes something special <br>
Out of our school everyday

  

At our school we are taught to obey <br>
And our school is a church where we pray <br>
For God's love makes something special <br>
Out of our school everyday

  

And Chapels every Wednesday <br>
Are best of all to me <br>
For we are all together <br>
Just the way we like to be

  

Yes our school is filled with laughter and play <br>
And our school is where I want to stay <br>
For our love makes something special <br>
Out of our school everyday

  

For our love makes something special <br>
Out of PL everyday

I hear the bells of PL ring <br>
The notes of golden youth; <br>
I hear His voice in every peal <br>
Calling me to seek the Truth <br>
I hear, and seek to make my life <br>
A mirror of His shining light, <br>
Do the chimes stir within your heart <br>
His awesome peace and might?

  

Let your light so shine before men <br>
That all may see His face; <br>
Let our school be a torch aflame <br>
Teaching love and His saving grace.

  

I hear the pipes of PL sound <br>
The Majesty of God. <br>
I hear the songs we sing in praise, <br>
Lifting His name with one accord, <br>
O PL girls make Him as our Lord; <br>
Let us enthrone Him as our King. <br>
Our God has promised those who trust <br>
His loving care and blessing.

  

### School Creed

I would be true for there are those who trust me&nbsp; <br>
I would be pure for there are those who care <br>
I would be strong for there is much to suffer <br>
I would be brave for there is much to dare.

I would be friend of all, the foe, the friendless&nbsp; <br>
I would be giving and forget the gift <br>
I would be humble for I know my weakness <br>
I would look up and love and laugh and lift.

  

I would be prayerful through each busy moment&nbsp; <br>
I would be constantly in touch with God <br>
I would be tuned to hear His slightest whisper <br>
I would have faith to tread the path Christ trod.
