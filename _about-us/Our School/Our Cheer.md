### School Prayer  
  

Our heavenly Father, we thank you that you are our Father <br>
and that you have guided and protected us and provided <br>
for us all these years.

  

We thank you for your love which sent Jesus to die for us. <br>
We pray Father, this day that you will come bless your school, <br>
Paya Lebar MGS, that will be a sanctuary to all who come <br>
to study, work and serve within these walls.

  

Enbue our teachers with wisdom and love, <br>
with patience and the right judgement. <br>
Enbue our pupils with knowledge and virtue that our girls <br>
may grow in grace, in wisdom and in favour with God and man.

  

Make each of us, Father, a channel of blessing <br>
to the homes and communities from which we come.

  

Above all, grant us, Father, a spirit of cheerful obedience and <br>
faithful service, as we dedicate ourselves anew to learn and to doÂ  <br>
Thy Holy Will to bring glory to Thy Holy Name, <br>
through Jesus Christ out Lord.

PLMGS <br>
PL girls will do their best <br>
PLMGS <br>
With honour, vigour hold the crest <br>
PL girls with one accord, <br>
Win or lose, we'll praise the Lord.

  

1. We've got the spirit you can't beat, <br>
There's not a single team that can compete <br>
We'll all be singing, praise Him <br>
Cos' we've got the spirit you can't beat.

  

2. We're on our way to claim their victory, <br>
We'll do our best, so wait and see <br>
We gonna fly our flag and build our dream <br>
And sing our battle cry with vigour.

  

3. In blue and gold we'll be standing proud <br>
And doing cheers together shouting loud <br>
PL forever more <br>
Will march on the fore.
