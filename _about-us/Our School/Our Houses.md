### Archer

<img src="/images/KV6T8602.jpg" style="width:60%">

Archer House is named after Bishop R.L. Archer. in 1950. Bishop Archer was the first bishop to be elected by the South-East Asia Central Conference. Bishop Archer had many years of missionary service in Java, Sumatra, and Malaya. He contributed significantly to education in Malaya; he is fondly remembered for speaking classical Malay to the delight and appreciation of all who heard him at the opening ceremony of the Klang ACS. During the opening ceremony of our school in Boundary Road in 1953 by Mr R. E, Ince Singapore Service, Bishop Archer officiated in Dedication Service of Education. He was also on the board of Education in 1953. Mrs Archer was a popular chapel speaker at PLMGS, Boundary Road in the early 50s, being a good friend of Rev. and Mrs Chew.

### Dodsworth

Dodsworth House is named after Dr. and Mrs Marmaduke Dodsworth. Dr. Dodsworth was an American missionary and was a regular speaker at the chapel services. He began his work in Malacca in 1922 at the Malacca Anglo Chinese School. With his wife, he acquired land to build a hostel, so that the local boys from outlying districts of Malacca were able to stay in the hostel and study in the school. He was also the principal of ACS Malacca in 1924. Dr. and Mrs Dodsworth were resident missionaries of the Methodist Mission in Malacca. They were instrumental in the erection of the current MGS-Malacca's primary school through the raising of funds. Despite their tight programme, they taught a co-education class of Anglo Chinese School and Methodist Girls' School students in the afternoons.

### Chew

Chew House is named after Rev. and Mrs Chew Hock Hin. One of the persons closely connected with the reorganisation and development of our school was Mrs Chew Hock Hin. She left her teaching post at MGS in 1934 to serve PLMGS, then known as Methodist English Preparatory School. The onus of re-oganising the school became her responsibility. Besides administrative work, she had to do much of the teaching under trying circumstances. Two classes had to be accommodated in the same classroom. Had it not been for her unceasing efforts, initiative and foresight, the school would not have survived those difficult days. Mrs Chew was the principal of PLMGSS from 1946 to 1957. A word of tribute is also due to the Rev Chew Hock Hin for the services he rendered to our school - his personal efforts and keen interest in the school's building projects, and for looking after the spiritual welfare of our school.

### Lee

Lee House is named after Bishop Edwin F. Lee. Bishop Lee's episcopal leadership was from 1928 to 1948, with missionary experience in Malaya, Java and the Philippines. He began to place local persons in positions of responsibility as he began the process known as Malayanisation. Bishop Lee was the pastor when the K.L. Epworth League (similar to our present day youth fellowship) was formed in 1912. Bishop Lee played an active part in Methodist education in Malaysia, where he served as a form-master in Malayan school as part of his missionary calling. Bishop Lee laid the corner-stone for the Sitiawan Anglo Chinese School (Perak) in 1936. He helped the late Rev. and Mrs Chew Hock Hin to reorganise PLMGS after World War II.
