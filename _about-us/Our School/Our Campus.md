### Conducive spaces for revision and self-study in PL

We have always encouraged the girls to find a safe and conducive space to study and revise their school work. Many girls study in groups or singly outside their homes. Sometimes, it is not so easy to find a conducive learning area in the public libraries, malls or the fast-food restaurants. We encourage our girls to study in school. The following are conducive areas in school where the girls can study at:

### ‘Every Corner, A Story’ Walking Trail

PLMGS Sec has been through many phases of changes over the last 100 years. At the end of our Centennial year in 2016, we embarked on a project to create a walking trail for all visitors to explore our school’s rich culture and heritage in every corner of our campus. We hope that this will promote a sense of returning to our roots and an appreciation for our heritage and culture. Stories that build the identity of the school will continue to be told to the future generations of girls. We pray that these stories will continue to bless hearts and build the identity of our school.

There are altogether 10 significant stops along the ‘Every Corner, A Story’ Walking Trail in PL Sec. Each stop tells a story of God’s faithfulness and blessing.

    <td class="tg-7an4">Inspired by Genesis 28:10-22<br><br>Specially designed by Brother Joseph McNally (1923–2002), then President of Lasalle-SIA, college of the Arts, the sculpture was unveiled by then-Bishop Ho Chee Sin during PLMGS 80th Thanksgiving Celebrations on 14 Oct 1996.<br><br>According to the account given in Genesis 28, Jacob dreamt that he saw a ladder and angels ascending and descending from it. The Lord promised him the land and His presence: “And, behold, I am with thee, and will keep thee in all places whither thou goest.” Gen 28:15. In response to God’s promises, Jacob took his stone pillow and erected a pillar of loyalty to God. In the same way, PLMGS also erected this sculpture as a pillar of loyalty to our God for His faithfulness and provision for us.<br><br>The top stone stands for the pillow on which Jacob slept. The bronze ladder leading towards an open window of a school chapel symbolizes the ladder that the angels climbed on in Jacob’s vision. Heaven is symbolized by the blue window at roof of the school chapel. The whole sculpture, with its various stones and bronzes, represents Jacob's Pillar. The sculpture also has a built-in offering box for students to put in their ‘dimes’ – “the least coin” in thanksgiving to God.</td>

Water flows down rocks into a quiet pool. In this special space is a bronze sculpture of The Shepherd’s Staff.<br><br>This sculpture is a gift from Mrs Goh Choo Woon and her three daughters who are PL-Lites – Joyce, Doreen and Mabel Goh. This was a special gift in memory of their late father – Dr Goh Choo Woon, who was a member of the PLMGS Board of Management in 1985- 1989.<br><br>The Shepherd’s Staff reminds us that Jesus is our Shepherd and we are His sheep. If we put our trust in Jesus, He will guide us on our way and bring us back when we stray.

    <td class="tg-fwnj">The Fish Pond reminds us of Matthew 4:18-20. This account is one that tells of Jesus calling His First Disciples:<br><br>“As Jesus was walking beside the Sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon called Peter and his brother Andrew. They were casting a net into the lake, for they were fishermen. “Come, follow me,” Jesus said, “and I will send you out to fish for people.” At once they left their nets and followed him.”<br><br>Nothing in Scripture seems to indicate the first disciples were anything but ordinary men doing their best to earn a living. Jesus chose those men not based on their special gifts or talents. He chose them knowing they were in the hands of a Savior who loved them, who would never leave them, and who would show them the way.<br><br>Jesus has also chosen us to be a ‘fisher of men’ as well. He chose us because of who He is a Savior who loves us and who is continually about the business of molding us to be more and more like Him. As we watch and listen to Him through His Word and grow in our understanding of who He is, He shows us how to love and serve others.<br><br>Fish food is available at $0.20 a pack for feeding from the General Office, Monday – Friday, 9 a.m. – 10 a.m. and 12 noon – 1 p.m.</td>

It is a 200-metre, 6-lane synthetic track constructed at an estimated cost of $300,000. It is our hope that PL Track 3:14 will encourage PL-Lites and staff to exercise and keep healthy.<br><br>The name ‘PL Track 3:14’ is inspired by Paul’s letter to the Philippians in the verse Phil 3:14. He implored all to “press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus”. PL Track 3:14 is a reminder of life's race that we all must run well. At the end of our race, we hope to achieve the Crown of Glory and hear the Lord’s affirmation: “Well done, thou good and faithful servant.”</td>

As PLMGS celebrates 100 years of the Lord’s blessings in 2016, we are seeking to renovate and redevelop the current PLMGS Museum to be an interactive exhibition. The PLMGS Museum will be designed to facilitate self-guided tours for current cohorts of PL-Lites from the Primary and Secondary sections and our School Alumni who have been dropping by to reminiscence about their school days.<br><br>The redeveloped PLMGS Museum will continue to house our own collection of PLMGS artefacts, representing generations of girls who have passed through our sheltering walls. The PLMGS Museum will be a place where stories of God's faithfulness and blessings, and the hard work of our Pioneers will be told and retold to all who enter. We look forward to seeing hearts encouraged and lives uplifted through this venture.<br><br>The PLMGS Museum was officially reopened on 14 Oct 2016 by 9 generations of PL-Lites during the Founder’s Day Thanksgiving Service in school.</td>

    <td class="tg-fwnj">One night a man had a dream. He dreamed he was walking along the beach with God. Across the sky flashed scenes from his life. <br>For each scene, he noticed two sets of footprints in the sand. One belonged to him and the other to God. When the last scene of his life flashed before him. he looked back at the footprints in the sand. <br>He noticed that many times along the path of his life there was only one set of footprints. He also noticed that it happened at the very lowest and saddest times in his life. This really bothered him and he questioned God about it, “You said that once I decided to Follow you, you’d walk with me all the way. But I have noticed that during the most troublesome times in my life, there is only one set of footprints. I don’t understand why when I needed you most you would leave me alone.” <br>God replied, “My precious, precious man, I love you and I would never leave you. During your times of trial and suffering, when you see only one set of footprints, it was then that I carried you.”<br><br> Moral of this story: We are never ever alone, especially during our most trying times. God is always with us.</td>

Through this miracle, God demonstrates that He is able to amplify a small offering into abundant provisions to meet our needs. His power, love, compassion and goodness was demonstrated through the miracle.<br><br>This mural was the key feature of our canteen in the old PL days in the late 1980s  - early 2000s, reminding us constantly of God’s faithfulness and provision for all of our needs in PL. It is a labour of love by our Art teachers and parents. Today, a replica of the original mural takes its pride of place in the center stage of the school canteen. Indeed, we believe that God is able to provide abundantly for all at PL, above all that we can ever ask or think.</td>
