The PL DOE are translated into a set of developmental student outcomes for each key stage of our education system. The Key Stage Outcomes spell out what our school aspires to develop in our PL-Lites through Lower Secondary and Upper Secondary education. Each educational level builds upon the previous stages and lays the foundation for subsequent ones.
