The philosophy of the school is based on the biblical text - “And Jesus grew in wisdom and stature and in favour with God and men.” Luke 2:52. With this in mind, the school has a 4-fold objective, namely to bring up a PL-Lite so that she:-  
  
### 1. “...will grow in wisdom...”
  
1.1 Our major objective is to equip our students with academic qualifications. We will take into account a student’s abilities and draw out the best in her. The aim will be to inculcate in the students the idea that while in some instances, they may not be the best, they must do their best.  
  
1.2 As our students come in a range of intellectual ability and from all walks life, streaming is necessary so as to cater to different needs.  
  
1.3 The policy of bilingualism will be vigorously enforced.

### 2. “...and in stature...” 
  
2.1 The Physical Educational Programme and CCA Programme will aim at making our students healthy in mind and body. Our objective is to make them physically fit so that they can study, perform their work and live life to the fullest.  
  
### 3. “...and in favour with God...” 
  
3.1 Intricately woven into the fabric of our philosophy is our belief in giving our students a faith that will stand them in good stead when they face pressures in life and assume adult responsibilities.  
  
3.2  We believe religion is part of life and in giving education, we cannot blot out what is life itself.  
  
3.3  Our 2-pronged objective is to increase the faith of Christian students and to introduce the Christian faith to others.  
  
3.4  Religion will be a ballast to enable our students to lead moral lives.  
  
3.5  The Christian faith will be consciously promoted in corporate acts of worship and religious instruction outside curriculum time, and in the life of love and care that students will experience in the school.

### 4. “...and men...”
  
4.1 Our fourth objective is to prepare our students for responsible citizenship, to create women of vision, of love and concern, who will take their place beside the men.  
  
4.2  We aim to have a high-spirited student body. This does not necessarily mean they must all be intellectual or national sportswomen, but it does mean having a high morale. For this reason, developing a good school tradition is important. It is one effective way of sustaining student morale.  
  
4.3  We are conscious that we produce not only professional women, but mothers and homemakers whose influence is no less great. Towards the end, we will teach values consistent with responsible parenthood.  
  
4.4  We shall consciously seek to inculcate in our students a pride in our national heritage and a belief in our nation as a great nation built on honesty and hard work.  
  
4.5  We will instil in our staff and students the belief in work as a God- given duty, a contribution to the happiness and welfare of other persons.  
  
### 5. The principal and staff of the school will be conscious at all times of the Trust, Privilege and Opportunity entrusted to them
  
5.1 Trust – The school premises, teaching apparatus, furniture are a trust. These will be looked after and improved upon. Time spent in the school is a sacred trust to be properly utilised.  
  
5.2  Privilege – The privilege of sharing with the parents the sacred task of bringing up children must always be in the forefront of our minds.  
  
5.3  Opportunity – Coupled with this privilege is the opportunity for us to give what we have received. We must seize this opportunity every day of our lives.  
  
We have adopted the words of a hymn written by Howard Walter – “I would be true” as our school creed. The words embody the ideals and standards the school has set for our students. In every line, there is high idealism and a challenge to courageous living.  
  
### School Creed  
**“I would be True”**  
  
I would be true for there are those who trust me  <br>
I would be pure for there are those who care  <br>
I would be strong for there is much to suffer  <br>
I would be brave for there is much to dare.  
  
I would be friend of all, the foe, the friendless  <br>
I would be giving and forget the gift  <br>
I would be humble for I know my weakness  <br>
I would look up and love and laugh and lift.  
  
I would be prayerful through each busy moment  <br>
I would be constantly in touch with God  <br>
I would be tuned to hear His slightest whisper  <br>
I would have faith to tread the path Christ trod.
