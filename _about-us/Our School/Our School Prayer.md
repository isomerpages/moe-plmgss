Our heavenly Father, we thank You that You are our Father and that You have guided and protected us and provided for us all these years. We thank You for Your love which sent Jesus to die for us. We pray Father, this day that You will bless Your school, Paya Lebar MGS, that it will be a sanctuary to all who come to study, work and serve within these walls.  
  
Endue our teachers with wisdom and love, with patience and right judgement.  
  
Endue our students with knowledge and virtue that our girls may grow in grace, in wisdom and stature and in favour with God and man.  
  
Make each of us, Father, a channel of blessing to the homes and communities from which we come.  
  
Above all, grant us, Father, a spirit of cheerful obedience and faithful service, as we dedicate ourselves anew to learn and to do Thy Holy Will to bring glory to Thy Holy Name, through Jesus Christ our Lord.  
  
Amen.
