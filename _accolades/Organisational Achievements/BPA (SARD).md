In Paya Lebar Methodist Girls’ School (Secondary) (PL), an integrative approach with customisation to meet and develop her pupils’ needs, interests and talents is adopted in structuring her brand of holistic education, nurturing her pupils towards the vision of producing women of fine character. This encapsulates a range of school-designed programmes and a key signature programme ‘PL Overseas Community Involvement’ which facilitate pupils’ development in the five domains (cognitive, social & moral, leadership, aesthetic and physical) synergistically. These programmes provide opportunities to develop each pupil towards the PL’s desired outcomes (DOE) - confident individual, passionate learner, active citizen and inspiring leader.

  

A structured assessment framework that is both developmental and performance-oriented is used to monitor and assess pupils’ development in the five domains in alignment to the PL DOE. School-designed assessment tools such as CAsT and LeADer, which provide information on the competencies levels of the desired pupils’ outcomes, enable pupils to reflect and chart their development. It has also allowed teachers to assist pupils in their journey of continuous improvement to reach the outcomes.

  

In a school where continuous improvement is her culture, benchmarking specific processes with comparable schools is critical and in PL, the learning is always extended. For aesthetics excellence, the benchmarking efforts provided insights on the importance of building partnerships and raising students’ engagement in Arts appreciation. The extended outcome of the benchmarking efforts was the collaborative effort with benchmarking schools in creating an aesthetics assessment rubric.
