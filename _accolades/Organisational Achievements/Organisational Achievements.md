<p>The National Arts Education Award (NAEA) is a national arts award for
Ministry of Education (MOE) schools. Conferred by NAC, the award affirms
schools that develop holistic arts education for their students. The biennial
award affirms schools that develop holistic arts education for their students,
provides all schools with a framework to guide the development of good
arts education practices and programmes</p>
<p>In 2012, PL Sec attained the Blaze Award, the top category of NAEA. The
Blaze Award is conferred to schools which have built a vibrant arts culture
and advocate the arts. The Blaze awardees are also recognised for championing
the arts and contributing to the community.</p>
<p>In 2016, PL Sec becomes one of the few second time recipient of NAEA Blaze
Awardees. This is a testimony of PL's effort in nurturing the PL-Lites
into gracious women of fine character.</p>
<p>The National Arts Education Award (NAEA) has been discontinued in 2017
in line with MOE’s shift away from awards for schools. PLMGS will continue
to provide a rich Arts experience for all PL-Lites.</p>
