##### Sharing our Success Stories

We are proud of the following girls who exemplified our School Core Value of ‘Excellence’ and performed exceedingly well in both the academic and non-academic areas:
	
**(1)&nbsp;Tan Yoke Woon Jael (Sec 4.5, 2022)**<br>
<font size="6"><b><i>‘Trust Yourself… Presevere and Do Not Give Up’</i></b></font>
<img class="ive_eobj_left" alt="lim_lei_ya.png" src="/images/olevel2023_tan_yoke_woon_jael.png" style="width:50%"><br>
Steely resilience and a strong drive to stay motivated would aptly describe Jael. Though it may seem like a simple strategy, meticulous note-taking, consistent effort to clarify doubts and regular revision, proved effective for this young lady. Jael's diligent work ethic saw her achieve the Edusave Good Progress Award in 2020 and 2021, which was given to the top 10% who made significant improvement in their academic performance. <br><br>Not forgetting the community at large, Jael kept up a positive mindset while working through challenges. Taking on additional duties of performing voiceovers for videos designed for the Christian Outreach to the Handicapped did not faze her.  A responsible Class Monitor in 2020 and a passionate Class Esther from 2021 to 2022, Jael leveraged on the roles entrusted to her to reach out to her classmates as a means of fellowship and encouragement. The experience has helped forge lasting friendships while being a positive influence on others. <br><br>Her journey was hardly a smooth one for Jael as she had to manage inconveniences brought about by changes to her residential arrangements and she sometimes faced challenges finding conducive spaces to settle into her revision routines. Not one to gripe, she explored alternatives in the community, such as the public library, to solve the problem.<br><br>Some advice Jael has for her juniors, is to start early and plan ahead.  Avoiding late night cramming sessions is also recommended. More importantly, she found it critical to have the support of peers for a shoulder to lean on when the going gets tough. As a parting gift, Jael had this to say. “Trust yourself! Even when all seems too tough, persevere and do not give up!” <br><br>PL wishes Jael all the very best for her future. Jael aspires to move on to a junior college to continue her education.
	
**(2) Goh Sze Leng Eliza (Sec 4.2, 2022)**<br>
<font size="6"><b><i>‘Balance Work and Play … Enjoy Life a Little’</i></b></font>
<img class="ive_eobj_left" alt="lim_lei_ya.png" src="/images/olevel2023_goh_sze_leng_eliza.png" style="width:50%"><br>
Eliza has always exemplified perseverance and is one who has displayed strength through adversity. Despite having to cope with a hearing impairment, she has not allowed it to get in the way of her achievements.<br><br>The last two years had been particularly tough for Eliza as she had to cope with the challenges that came with the pandemic. She did not wish, nor expect her teachers or peers to treat her any differently and worked hard in her own way to avoid needing special treatment. However, as she was dependent on a hearing aid, as well as FM transmitter, the mandatory use of a mask made it particularly difficult for her to communicate with her classmates as she was unable to hear them well or read their lips. She shared that this was especially difficult during group work, but she was thankful that her classmates and teachers were always understanding and kind.<br><br>Eliza refused to allow these challenges to drag her down and consistently showed passion for life in all that she did, taking pride in aiming for excellence in both her academic studies and her CCA. She had joined PLMGS (Sec) via DSA Talent Area in Badminton. She participated in the National School Games as a member of the school’s Badminton team and her hard work paid off when she was placed on the Dean's List for Academic Excellence in 2022.<br><br>
Known to be a resilient and determined student, Eliza was always seen as a role model for her peers. She had a positive attitude towards her studies and took her work seriously. She always strived for excellence in everything she did and was tenacious in overcoming challenges that came her way. She hopes to encourage her fellow PL-Lites to balance work and play and leaves them with this advice: “Enjoy life a little!”
