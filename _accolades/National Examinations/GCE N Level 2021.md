“**Don’t Stop Believing…**” 
- from the NA Course,  **ZOEN - JEAN LEE ZHU EN (Sec 4.7)**  
-  _2 Distinction, 9 points_

     style="width:40%">
		 
Despite having been diagnosed with Dyslexia, Dyspraxia and Sensory Integration Disorder, Zoen always faced all challenges to her learning needs with optimism and a strong resolve. She believed in challenging herself and even took up O-Level Mathematics and Art. She was enthusiastic in contributing to class activities by leveraging on her creativity and talents. For example, she showed initiative and decorated the classroom for special occasions and designed the class t-shirt. In her CCA, she was passionate about leading her peers to hone their photography skills and readily shared to help them improve their photo-taking techniques. She never let her learning difficulties affect her ability to build strong relationships with her peers and fostered a vibrant and positive culture in her CCA. She overcame various hurdles with a great deal of resilience and was mature and independent in managing her academic and extra-curricular activities in her secondary school journey. When asked if she had a message for her juniors, Zoen had this to say, _“Don’t stop believing. Always believe that you can reach your goals. It was my will power that helped me get to where I am today.”_

“**Just give your best, and God will do the rest**”
– from the NA Course,  **ZULAIHA RASEENA BINTE KHALIT (Sec 4.7)**  
– _6 Distinctions, 8 points_

<img src="/images/zulaiha.png" 
     style="width:40%">
		 
Zulaiha was from the Normal (Technical) stream and put in consistent hard work to achieve good results, allowing her to transfer to the Normal (Academic) stream in Secondary 2. Even with the more demanding academic workload, Zulaiha handled the challenges with a positive learning attitude and a great deal of resilience.  Her commendable academic performance earned her Edusave Scholarships in 2018, 2019 and 2020. Despite her many achievements, Zulaiha remained humble and constantly showed care and concern to the people around her. She was a good role model to her peers as a caring, respectful and resilient individual, and this earned her the MOE-Edusave Character Award. Ever the modest one, she had this advice for her peers, _“Never compare yourself with others. Just give your best, and God will do the rest.”_

“**Never Give Up**”
– from the NT Course, **TANG WAN ZHI (Sec 4.8)**  
_– EMB2 10 points_

<img src="/images/wanzhi.png" 
     style="width:40%">
		 
2021 proved to be a challenging time for many, and it was no different for Wan Zhi. Without a learning device that she could call her own, getting online to follow lessons became a daily struggle. However, she was determined to do her best and never allowed what she lacked to become an obstacle towards success. 2021 saw her trying to juggle her time between studies and her commitment to the SYF rehearsals for her CCA (Concert Band). It was tough focusing on her studies when her mind was sometimes on the music scores of her timpani. Inspired by an encouraging classmate who scored better than her, and who in turn became her study buddy, Wan Zhi made up her mind that she was going to embrace her class motto – Be the best that you can be. She burnt the midnight oil, revised consistently, clarified when in doubt and even helped others who were weaker in the subjects she was stronger in. Her perseverance yielded good results and that motivated her even further. Wan Zhi's ‘_never give up_’ attitude, coupled with encouragement she received from her friends, teachers and unconditional support from her mother has shaped her strength and determination to do well in her studies. When asked what the secret to her success was, she said, _“With perseverance, success is just around the corner.”_ Indeed, it is.

“**Overcoming All Odds**”  
– from the NT Course, **Wong XIN YI DAWN (Sec 4.8)** 
– _EMB2 7 points_

<img src="/images/dawn.png" 
     style="width:40%">
		 
The loss of her mother when she was in primary school was a huge blow to Dawn and this negatively affected her studies. Her relatives played an important role in supporting both her father and her through this difficult time. Secondary school proved to be a turning point in Dawn’s journey. Despite her ADHD condition, she was diligent and attentive during lessons despite the distractions she found around her. She struggled with school work and needed more time to keep up with her lessons. However, she had a positive attitude towards her studies and was keen to excel. She put in extra effort to overcome her struggles with spelling and word recognition and passed her English at a higher stream. Dawn always put the needs of others before her own and tried her best to extend her help to her classmates who were in need of emotional and academic support. In 2021, Dawn had to manage her time between her studies and her commitment to her CCA, Concert Band. She was in the percussion section and had to devote her time practicing the different instruments in preparation for the SYF, while preparing for her N-Level examinations at the same time. Finding confidence when her hard work was rewarded with good grades, she continued her hard work throughout her four years in PL to obtain excellent results for N Level.  Dawn embodies how drive and self-determination to succeed can help achieve one’s goals. Regardless of the challenges she encounters, she always faces them with optimism and resolve. Dawn’s motto in life is ‘Work hard, play hard’. When asked if there was anyone she wanted to credit for her results, she gratefully said, *“I want to thank my uncle, who was always there for me.”*
