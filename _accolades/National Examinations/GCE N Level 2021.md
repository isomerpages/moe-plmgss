Despite having been diagnosed with Dyslexia, Dyspraxia and Sensory Integration Disorder, Zoen always faced all challenges to her learning needs with optimism and a strong resolve. She believed in challenging herself and even took up O-Level Mathematics and Art. She was enthusiastic in contributing to class activities by leveraging on her creativity and talents. For example, she showed initiative and decorated the classroom for special occasions and designed the class t-shirt. In her CCA, she was passionate about leading her peers to hone their photography skills and readily shared to help them improve their photo-taking techniques. She never let her learning difficulties affect her ability to build strong relationships with her peers and fostered a vibrant and positive culture in her CCA. She overcame various hurdles with a great deal of resilience and was mature and independent in managing her academic and extra-curricular activities in her secondary school journey. When asked if she had a message for her juniors, Zoen had this to say, _“Don’t stop believing. Always believe that you can reach your goals. It was my will power that helped me get to where I am today.”_

Zulaiha was from the Normal (Technical) stream and put in consistent hard work to achieve good results, allowing her to transfer to the Normal (Academic) stream in Secondary 2. Even with the more demanding academic workload, Zulaiha handled the challenges with a positive learning attitude and a great deal of resilience.  Her commendable academic performance earned her Edusave Scholarships in 2018, 2019 and 2020. Despite her many achievements, Zulaiha remained humble and constantly showed care and concern to the people around her. She was a good role model to her peers as a caring, respectful and resilient individual, and this earned her the MOE-Edusave Character Award. Ever the modest one, she had this advice for her peers, _“Never compare yourself with others. Just give your best, and God will do the rest.”_
