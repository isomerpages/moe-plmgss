<div style="text-align: justify;"><b><u>(1) Sharing our Success Stories </u></b><br><br><font size="6"><b><i>“Be determined, remain focused and never give up” </i></b></font><br>- from the NA Course, <b>Lim Lei Ya (Sec 4.6) </b><br>
</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">- <b>5 Distinctions, 6 points </b><br>
</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><br>
</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><img class="ive_eobj_left" alt="lim_lei_ya.png" src="/images/lim_lei_ya.png">Diagnosed with Severe Aplastic Anaemia at the age of 14 years old, Lei Ya has long since realised the need to be resilient, determined and to persevere through the challenges that came her way. She was often breathless, could not run and was not allowed around crowds and thus had to take a two-year leave of absence from school to receive treatment. When she returned to school, she had to work hard to close learning gaps, make new friends and cope with health challenges related to her treatment. In her academic work, she conscientiously made personal improvements to achieve better results and always had a strong drive to achieve her goals. In recognition of her efforts, in 2021, she was placed on the Dean’s List for Academic Excellence and awarded the Edusave Scholarship. Lei Ya also understood the value of CCA and joined her juniors to teach herself the basics of playing the Guzheng and her humility and willingness to learn was an inspiration to her CCA mates. She showed her leadership skills when she stepped up as a Peer Support Leader to organise and lead the Secondary 1 Orientation Camp. <br><br>Throughout her years in PL, she remained positive and tenacious, and was able to build positive relationships with others through her ability to empathise and understand the challenges others were going through, as she has experienced similar challenges before. When asked what her advice for her juniors was, Lei Ya had this to say, <i>“I’ll always be grateful to my kind friends who always made me feel included. My advice is to always be determined and remain focused and never give up. Just because you fail once, it doesn’t mean you won’t be able to continue in life.”</i><br><br><br><font size="6"><b><i>“Even if you face tough circumstances, never give up” </i></b></font><br>– from the NA Course, <b>NUR AISYAH BINTE AZMAN (Sec 4.6) </b><br>– <b>1 Distinction, 12 points </b><br>&nbsp;<br><img class="ive_eobj_left" alt="aisyah.png" src="/qql/slot/u173/Accolades/GCE-N-Level/2022/aisyah.png">Known to be a dynamic and reliable student leader, Aisyah was always seen as a positive example for her peers. She had a positive attitude towards her studies and took her work seriously. She always strived for excellence in everything she did and had the ability to think independently. In her years in PLMGS(S), Aisyah was an exemplary and inspiring leader as she stepped up to be the House Vice-Captain, Peer Support Leader and Class Monitor. She was awarded the MOE Edusave Character Award in 2022. While juggling her varied responsibilities in school, Aisyah also had the added responsibility of putting time aside every day to look after her younger siblings and manage her household duties as well. Despite the challenge of balancing so much on her plate, she doubled down and worked harder. She continued steadfastly in her responsibilities and never once wavered or gave up. She attributed her success to the words of encouragement she remembers receiving from close friends and teachers. Her advice to her juniors was, <i>“Study hard and don’t give up. Even if you face tough circumstances, never give up. Always look at the bright side.”</i><br><br><br><br><font size="6"><i><b>“Believe in yourself. Don’t let negative thoughts get in the way.” </b></i></font><br>– from the NT Course, <b>Bernice Yeo Ching Ning (Sec 4.8) </b><br>– <b>3 Distinctions, 5 points </b><br><br><img class="ive_eobj_left" alt="bernice.png" src="/qql/slot/u173/Accolades/GCE-N-Level/2022/bernice.png">Bernice Yeo struggled with dyslexia and had a difficult time making sense of her work in class. Reading and writing were difficult and she had to get help from her teachers and peers to help her in her work. But she pushed on with grit and had a positive attitude toward learning. She devoted her time and energy in the pursuit of excellence in all that she did. Her determination to clarify and challenge assumptions is the key to her success. Ever the critical thinker, she would often approach her teachers after lessons to clarify doubts and express her thoughts. In addition to her academic pursuits, she had to balance her commitment to her CCA, The Girl’s Brigade. She was part of the GB company that achieved the Company Award (Gold) in 2022 while preparing for her N-Level examinations at the same time. She embodies the value of perseverance; and in the face of adversities, she faces them with optimism. She would often motivate herself by thinking about her family, friends, and future career. She pushes herself to succeed and hopes to be a hairstylist one day. Her parting words for her juniors would be, <i>“It is fine to ask for help when one needs it. Don’t be shy to open up and always continue to believe in yourself. Don’t let negative thoughts get in the way.”</i><br><br><br><b>(2) N Level Results 2022 (4NA &amp; 4NT) <br></b><br><b>(a) Cohort Achievements for the 2022 Students in the 4N(A) Course</b><br><br>We would like to celebrate the efforts of the following students who have done especially well for the <b>GCE N(A)</b> Examinations.<br>&nbsp;<br>
