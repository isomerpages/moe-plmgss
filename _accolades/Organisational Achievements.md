The National Arts Education Award (NAEA) is a national arts award for Ministry of Education (MOE) schools. Conferred by NAC, the award affirms schools that develop holistic arts education for their students. The biennial award affirms schools that develop holistic arts education for their students, provides all schools with a framework to guide the development of good arts education practices and programmes  
  
In 2012, PL Sec attained the Blaze Award, the top category of NAEA. The Blaze Award is conferred to schools which have built a vibrant arts culture and advocate the arts. The Blaze awardees are also recognised for championing the arts and contributing to the community.  
  
In 2016, PL Sec becomes one of the few second time recipient of NAEA Blaze Awardees. This is a testimony of PL's effort in nurturing the PL-Lites into gracious women of fine character.  
  

The National Arts Education Award (NAEA) has been discontinued in 2017 in line with MOE’s shift away from awards for schools. PLMGS will continue to provide a rich Arts experience for all PL-Lites.
