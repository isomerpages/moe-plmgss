significant benefits in MOE.</p>
<p>The Science Department team comprising Mrs Tay Peck Hoon, Mr Alex Chiam

2018. Named the Instant MCQ Grading System. this innovation is to provide
for instant grading to facilitate instant feedback to students on their
possible areas of misconception. It greatly reduces the time between grading
and giving of feedback to students. It is well-established that if the
duration between the two is too long, students may even forget the questions
they have done.</p>

<br>This lesson package aims to help the Secondary One students to use models
as representations of atoms and the particles in an atom. Instead of frontal
teaching, the students were to collaborate and self-direct their own learning
to complete the activities in the learning package.
<br>
<br>The activities were designed and uploaded into the Student Learning Space
(SLS) which enables the different ICT applications and tools to be incorporated
into one platform. With the Quiz function in SLS, monitoring of students’
progress and understanding was made easier through the Heat map as immediate
feedback could be given to the students to address their misconceptions
and reinforce key ideas.

<p>
<br>A typical classroom model is one in which the teacher takes on the frontal
teaching and is talking most of the time. In flipped classroom model, the
main idea is to reverse the common instructional approach. Delivery of
content that used to occur in class is now accessed at home in the form
of a visual and auditory presentation, in advance of class.
<br>Class becomes the place to work through clarifications, problems, difficult
concepts and engage in 21CC skills pertaining to the lesson.
<br>Through this presentation, speakers will share their own experience of
using the flipped classroom model. Participants can experience how the
students engage in this type of pedagogy to facilitate teaching and learning
in class.

<p>Using Historical Role Play to interpret Historical Evidence in the Context
of Singapore’s Political Development after WWII
<br>
</p>
</td>
<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>The teaching of the post-war period in Singapore has traditionally posed
challenges to many teachers. Teachers have to grapple with unpacking a
highly complex and complicated historical era for students. Through the
use of historical role play, and by harnessing the historical concept of
empathy, students can better understand the perspectives and context of
various parties involved during that tumultuous times.
<br>The use of evidence drives the construction of this historical narrative,
as students interact with and question evidence in order to investigate
and re-enact the highly contested socio-political arena in the 1950s. What
is unique to this lesson package is that role play is applied in a consistent
and complementary manner, where students are given a character which they
have to maintain for the entire series of lessons. This enables students
to participate in events in the classroom, where evidence and History comes
alive.

<p>Flipping for Flexibility: Raising the Bar for Learning with Technology</p>
</td>
<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>How do we help our students prepare for a rapidly changing world? Technology
affects the way we communicate, work, and live.
<br>
<br>The staggering increase in the availability of technology tools has facilitated
an increase in the number of teachers who are "flipping" their classrooms;
that is, sending direct instruction home and reserving class time for reinforcement,
practice, and extension. But flipping also presents the challenge of how
to ensure active engagement and address diverse learning needs both at
home and at school.
<br>
<br>This session explores how to structure flipped learning experiences in
order to promote student engagement and differentiation of instruction.
We’ll explore opportunities to raise the bar for what’s expected, and what’s
possible, for learning with technology.</p>

<p>For the past five years, PLMGSS has embarked on the journey of using Transactional
Analysis (TA) to strengthen interactions between teachers and students,
build positive relationships and address student misbehaviour.
<br>In this sharing, PLMGSS will present on the school-wide implementation
of TA through leveraging on existing structures and processes. The use
of TA strategies empower teachers in better management of students’ misbehaviours.
<br>The impacts of the application of TA strategies will be discussed. This
includes enhancing the school’s strong caring culture, better student engagement
in learning and better student behaviours such as being less disruptive
and better behaved.</p>

<p>Transactional Analysis, Positive Education and Restorative Practices are
approaches that can help to equip teachers with competencies for TSR and
influence the school culture positively.
<br>
<br>These approaches:
<br>• Activate teachers’ positive regard for their students
<br>• Help teachers understand students better
<br>• Provide applicable tools for teachers to build TSR
<br>
<br>This workshop aims to provide a platform for teachers and schools to consider
how they can strengthen positive TSR through the use of school-wide approaches
- Transactional Analysis, Positive Education and Restorative Practices
- thus building a supportive network of positive relationships in schools.
This session will include sharing by 3 schools on how the approaches have
affected both staff and students in the way they relate and interact with
each other (TSR) and how that influence the school culture of care positively.
<br>
<br>At the end of the presentation, participants will be able to
<br>
<br>1.Learn how schools select an approach, and understand the factors that
promote and impede school implementation of Transactional Analysis, Positive
Education and Restorative Practices.
<br>
<br>2. Learn strategies under each approach for strengthening positive TSR
with students
<br>
<br>This session will be co-presented by GB Senior Specialists and 3 schools.
GB will provide the introduction and frame for the presentation giving
an overview of building a caring community in schools focusing on positive
TSR. This will be followed by schools’ facilitation to help participants
have a “taste”of/experience the approach, highlighting how each approach
has strengthened TSR and build school culture of care in their respective
schools. GB will close the session with a summary of common key factors
for effective school implementation of the approaches, followed by a short
Q&amp;A and reflection.</p>
