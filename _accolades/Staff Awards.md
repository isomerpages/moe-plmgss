### Innergy Award 2018

![](/images/innergyaward.jpg)

The Innergy Awards is a ministry-level award to recognise teams that have spent time developing, testing and implementing innovations to bring about significant benefits in MOE.  
  
The Science Department team comprising Mrs Tay Peck Hoon, Mr Alex Chiam and Mr Chai Wee Jie was awarded the Commendation Award in the Innergy Award 2018. Named the Instant MCQ Grading System. this innovation is to provide for instant grading to facilitate instant feedback to students on their possible areas of misconception. It greatly reduces the time between grading and giving of feedback to students. It is well-established that if the duration between the two is too long, students may even forget the questions they have done.

    <td class="tg-ncov">The teaching of the post-war period in Singapore has traditionally posed challenges to many teachers. Teachers have to grapple with unpacking a highly complex and complicated historical era for students. Through the use of historical role play, and by harnessing the historical concept of empathy, students can better understand the perspectives and context of various parties involved during that tumultuous times. <br>The use of evidence drives the construction of this historical narrative, as students interact with and question evidence in order to investigate and re-enact the highly contested socio-political arena in the 1950s. What is unique to this lesson package is that role play is applied in a consistent and complementary manner, where students are given a character which they have to maintain for the entire series of lessons. This enables students to participate in events in the classroom, where evidence and History comes alive.<br><br><a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="/files/2017%20-%20History%20Symposium%20Presentation%20Slides.pdf"><span style="text-decoration:underline;color:#454545">2017 - History Symposium Presentation Slides.pdf</span></a> </td>
