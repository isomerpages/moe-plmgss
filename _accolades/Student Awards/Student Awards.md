**Students’ reflections**  
  

“This carnival reminded us that despite the odds seemingly against our favour, it is imperative that we constantly encourage one another to keep each other’s spirit up. We understood how our inattention could lead to our greatest downfall, how our motivation could lead to our greatest glory and how the nuances in our mind-sets and attitude made all the difference.”  

**_Kwek Jia Xuan Tammie, Member of PL B Division Netball Team_**  

![](/images/East%20Zone%20Science%20Fair%202017.jpg)
  
“This was the first carnival where the Sec 2s and 3s played as a team and I felt that this carnival really showed me a lot. Although some of us felt demoralised when we first saw the fixtures as we were in a tough grouping, we made a goal for ourselves and worked towards that goal. Before every single game, everyone made sure they were warmed up well and this showed me that everyone was determined to fight. On the court, for all the opponents we faced, everyone stood strong against them and fought hard. Eventually, we topped the table, winning against the team we at first thought might lose to. There were tears and pressure. The games got tighter but no one backed down, we finally clinched 2nd placing. I was honestly surprised because I never thought we would go this far. This carnival really showed me every teammate’s fighting spirit and how a common goal could bring us so far. We constantly reminded ourselves that we wanted the medal. With our fighting spirit, we worked well together and supported each other. It felt good as I knew that not only me but everyone in my team wanted to win and that was my motivation to put in all my shots. This is a carnival that I would never forget, for all the emotions I felt and what I saw in all of my teammates.”  

_**Gladys Chia Xin Yi, Vice-Captain of the PL B Division Netball team**_  
  
“Since it was my last time playing in speed carnival with my team of Sec 2s and 3s, I wanted our team to do their best and land themselves in the finals. With the team’s goal in mind and the motivation from my teammates, I set my mind on the challenge ahead and to always be focused on what I truly want to achieve at the end. The teams that we were going against were really strong and I was initially worried that my team would be afraid but our team came in strong and had what it takes to win. We maintained our winning streak until that very last match against St Hilda’s Secondary where we fell short by one goal and clinched the silver medal instead. I am still very proud of my team because we worked very hard as a team together and took every game as an opportunity to improve our skills and prove ourselves that we are one PL team. I felt touched to see my teammates working hard and I was very motivated as I knew that I was not working hard for that medal alone. I had my teammates’ assurance and determination as well to push me forward.”  

_**Charisse Lim Xuan Min, Captain of the PL B Division Netball Team**_

**Students’ Reflections**  
  
“This competitions was truly an inspiring and enriching one. It allowed me to test out my knowledge of robotics coding and programming and I have gained so much knowledge from the workshop and the competitions provided. The road ahead was a tough one. We encounter many obstacles that put my team under lots of pressure and not everything went smooth as we expected, even on the competition day itself. With determination and perseverance, we overcame each obstacle one by one until we emerged victorious. This competition has been a great learning opportunity.”  <br>
_**Adelaine Ruth Hanako Suhendro,&nbsp; 2.2**_  
  
“As this was my first time taking part in this competition. Our team had lots of issues in programming our robot as it did not turn out the way we wanted it to be.. However, we did not give up and tried our best to reprogram the codes so that our robot was able to complete the maze. Although our team did not get into the top 3, we were awarded with the best robot design. Through the process of preparation for the competition, I have learnt that no matter what circumstances we encounter, we should never give up and continue to press on till the very end. I also learnt that teamwork is a very important factor for a team as everyone have to work together and do their part in order to achieve the desired goal. Lastly, I realised that winning is not the only important thing to achieve in a competition but exposure and experienced we gained from the competition as well as the friendships forged are the ones that count.”  <br>
_**Sherlynn Yeo, 2.3**_  
  
"This competition has definitely widened my knowledge on technology and robotics and it was a good experience for me and my teammates as we had to get our robot to complete its mission, not giving up even when we faced several challenges."  <br>
_**Natasha Wee, 3A3**_  
  
“Through this competition, I have gained a lot of experience. Having to use the&nbsp;&nbsp; Arduino software for the first time, I had to start right from the basic to learn to program the robot. There were many setbacks in preparation for this competition but all our work had paid off. This is definitely largely due to the great teamwork and resilience in my team and the never ending will to push on to the last second. I'm thankful to the teachers who has made this possible for us students to participate in this competition. This was a great experience for me and one that I'll treasure and learn from in future activities.”  <br>
_**Gladys Cheng, 3A1**_  
  
“The iDigix 3D-tronics competition was a very good experience for me. Through it, I have learnt more about remote controlled robots, made new friends and gained exposure on robotics competitions in Singapore. .”  <br>
_**Janice Khoo, 3A1**_  
  
“Through this competition, I learn about team work and time management. I learnt that we need teamwork to go through this competition because without teamwork things cannot be done. I had fun during the competition and I look forward to future competitions.”  <br>
_**Faith Ng, 2.3**_  
  
“From this competition, I have learnt many things such as teamwork as well as thinking on my two feet. To do well in the competition, I had to work and communicate with my teammates. I also learnt how to control a robot with as well as how metal cannot be in contact a circuit board. We faced a few problems in this competition. However, we learnt how to solve those problems quickly and with the amount of resources we have. I made many friends from the competition and I am very thankful to be given this opportunity.”  <br>
_**Breann Ong, 1.1**_  
  
“Through this competition, I have learnt the importance of teamwork and communication. Through this competition, I have learnt that in order for a group to be successful, everyone MUST play a part in contributing to the team, be it for the presentation or showing up for meetings and adding ideas to better improve the robot.”  <br>
_**Timea Bay, 3B1**_

**Students’ Reflection**  
  
“Overall for this East Zone Competition, I felt happy and grateful that I was given the chance to compete and experience something academic lessons would not be able to give me. I also enjoyed the process of learning, fighting hard, defeat, victory with my teammates and I really treasure each and every one of them even though we don’t see eye to eye sometimes. I learnt many values like sportsmanship, determination, perseverance, and resilience to continue pressing on even if my team is losing. What’s important is that we are safe and have tried our very best, didn’t give up and were there for each other. I also feel that the bonds I have formed with my team will never be broken and we have gotten closer and can open up to each other better. I also think we did well overall and I am thankful that we clinched the top 4 position. This top 4 is for my team, my coaches, my teachers and those who were supporting us and I think we accomplished our goal.”  <br>
**_Karen Siew Ching Yi, Member of PL B Division Netball Team_**  
  
  
“I was privileged to get the opportunity to play many games. We experienced winning and losing games and we did learn a lot more by losing, giving us more and learning how to overcome our problems. As the going gets tough, I really want the team to become more united as one, having the team spirit to fight all the way and go far together.  <br>

**Students' Reflections:** 

“In this competition, our robot had quite a few breakdowns. During the competition itself, the unit faced tough competitions from other competitors. Through teamwork, communication and tolerance, we all managed to pull through, and that is really worth all the effort.”  <br>
**_Wee Chun Hui, 3A1_** 

  

“I feel that participating in this year’s World Robotics Games was definitely an enriching opportunity as I felt that it trained myself mentally and physically into adapting to different changes as well as new challenges to solve. I have learnt a lot from this experience and it has been a great learning opportunity.”  <br>
**_Lee Wen, 3A4_** 

  

“During the two days of the competition we met with many setbacks such as the wheels of the robot falling off or the screws coming lose on various parts of the robot. However, this competition has allowed me to be closer with my team mate, Chun Hui and exposed us to different forms of robotic technologies. When we first walked in for practice, many people from other schools, including parents and teachers looked at us, probably in disbelief. However, as we practiced and got the hang of things together with teamwork and communication, we eventually managed to emerge victorious and made our mark. The sense of satisfaction and euphoria that we felt when we finished the task was truly amazing. The experience has also taught me that nothing is impossible if you set your heart and mind to accomplishing it.”  <br>
**_Ling Yin, 3A1_** 

  

“This competition was a thrilling one compared to previous competitions our robotics unit had participated in. We entered this competition fully prepared but not knowing what the main challenges are. Though some problems came up on the competition day itself, we were able to fix them. Can't wait for our next competition to show other schools that our school can do robotics.”  <br>
**_Woo Jie Lyn, 3A2_** 

  

“As this is my first competition in robotics, I feel very honoured to be selected for participation. The competition gave me a lot of experience and I felt very happy having contributed my best. There were also challenges we faced. We struggled with the speed and tuning of the line tracer. Through this competition, I learnt that teamwork and sportsmanship is very important. Thank you PLMGSS for this experience!” <br>
**_Angel Yip, 1.2_** 

  

“I really enjoyed participating in WRG Singapore as it was a new experience for me. During the competition itself I learnt a lot about teamwork as my partner, Jia Min, and I had to work closely together to ensure that our robot could complete all challenges. I’m really glad I had the chance to take part in this competition along with the rest of the PL Robotics Unit!”  <br>
**_Julia, 3A3_** 

  

### iChef Competition

![](/images/iChef.png)

The NFS unit participated in this year’s ichef competition which was organised by Republic Polytechnic. A total of 3 teams from our PLMGSS participated in the above competition. The teams had to undergo 2 challenges, the first challenge was to create a fusion bento box lunch presentation and the other was to do a menu design for a Café in the qualifying round. A total of 108 teams from various schools participated in the qualifying round. One of our 3 teams, “PL Angels” qualified for the finals. In the finals the teams were to prepare 5 different types of Butler Passed Canapes featuring ingredients from the East to the West ends of the globe. The team practiced hard for the finals and worked diligently to present the canapes attractively. “PL Angels” came in 4 th place in this competition. 

  

**Students' Reflections:***

“The subject, Food and Nutrition, motivated us to cook different types of food. We are inspired and challenged to cook different type of interesting food. The creation of the menu, the process of brainstorming for the bento box and the workshops that we attended during the first round of competition had given us an eye opening experience. We never knew food can be infused and created in such a way. Through this competition we learned that teamwork and communication skills are important life skills in the working life. We have to learn how to communicate and work in a group to get things done. We sat down as a team to talk about the problems. As we talked and brainstormed, we found solutions to our problems and sometimes we can be very creative in our solutions.”  <br>

### PL ‘C’ Division Volleyball Team Makes History

![](/images/C%20Div%20Volleyball.png)

8 years after PL first established the Volleyball team, the PL ‘C’ Division Volleyball Team finally made history by clinching 3 d position in the East Zone ‘C’ Division Volleyball Championships and qualified for the nationals. The Volleyball girls trained 3 times a week and took part in a number of competitions to prepare themselves. During the East Zone ‘C’ Division Volleyball Championships 2016, the girls displayed great resilience to overcome injuries and illnesses and managed to beat some traditionally strong teams. The Volleyball girls will continue to put in their best effort during the nationals to bring honour to the school. 

  

**Students' Reflections:**

"To achieve something no one had ever achieved before in this school during our school’s 100 th anniversary is definitely unforgettable. I have learnt to push myself beyond my boundaries and always to persevere. Also, I have learnt the importance of teamwork and team spirit. I am looking forward to more of these experiences to come!"  <br>
**_Yap Jing Yi, Nadia, Vice-Captain of the PL C Division Volleyball Team_** 

  

"On the first day of the competition, we were surprised that we managed to beat our strong opponent despite playing the match immediately after our Sec 2 Camp. What was even more unimaginable was that we actually reached the nationals. This was beyond my expectations and it will be an experience I can never forget."  <br>
**_Faith Andreali M. Bunoan, team member of the PL C Division Volleyball Team_** 

  

### iDigix 3D-Tronics Challenge @ Labs 2016

![](/images/idigix.png)

The iDigix 3D-Tronics Challenge @ Labs 2016 is a competition that encourages students to think out of the box, develop problem solving and applied learning skills. It also allows team spirit among participation and learning through meaningful experiences. 

  

The challenge is designed to enable students to hone their skills in robotics programming, as well as to 3D-printing technology can come into place to solve or enhance the design of the robot and performance function. In addition, the theme of "Upcycling" is introduced for 2016's competition. Teams can also put their creativity to test by making use of recyclables to build their robots, transforming the recycled or unused materials at home into other useful applications. 

  

We are proud to announce that one team comprising of Woo Jie Lyn of 3A2, Charissa Wee of Sec 2.2 and Angel Yip of Sec 1.1 won the 2 nd Runner Up position in the Maze Explorer Senior Category. In the Arena Battle Open Category, our robotic girls Lee Wen of Sec 3A4, Andrea Seng of 3B1 and Christina Tan of Sec 2.4 were the champions defeating other competitors from institute of higher learning. Congratulation to the Robotic Teams of PLMGSS! 

  

**Students' Reflections: **

“Going for the 3D-tronics Challenge was a wonderful experience for me. In the competition, there were many people of different ages taking part in different categories with different styles. The competition made us step out of our comfort zones to learn from others and improve from there. I would like to thank our Principal Mrs Quek and our teacher Mr Indra for giving us the chance to broaden our knowledge about robotics by attending such competitions. I hope I will be able to attend more of such competitions in the future.”  <br>
**_Charissa Wee, 2.2_** 

  

“I feel that participating in this year’s 3D-Tronics Challenge was definitely an enriching opportunity as I felt that it trained me mentally and physically to adapt to different challenges during the Arena Battle games as well as having to think independently to solve new problems. I have learnt a lot from this experience and I am very thankful for this great learning opportunity.”  <br>
**_Lee Wen, 3A4_** 

  

“This competition was once again a challenge with the new category and tough program coding. We were all afraid that our robot may not work and we will not be able to make the school proud. We worked together to figure out all the problems with whatever tools available. This competition once again provided me with very enjoyable times that I can spend working together with my teammates.”  <br>
**_Woo Jie Lyn, 3A2_** 

  

“Taking part in the 2016 3D-tronics Challenge was very interesting especially when the challenges were different from last year. This year, my team and I entered the battle robot category and clinched champion position. I am proud of my team as we competed against institutes of higher learning such as the ITE. Through this competition, I managed to have more patience and strategise the movement for my robots depending on the situations. I am extremely thankful for the opportunity to take part in this year's 3D-tronics Challenge. I would like to thank our teacher-in-charge, Mr Indra, for guiding us through this competition and for giving us opportunities to take part in competitions and do the school proud.”  <br>
**_Andrea Seng, 3B1_** 

  

“This competition gave me a great opportunity to train up my focus. We needed to be focused and not get distracted by the people around us. We persevered to prepare the robot for the competition through Arduino Programming. I am happy that we were the 2nd runner up for the competition and hope to win more prizes for the school.”  <br>
**_Angel Yip, 1.1_** 

  

“I felt honoured as it is a rare opportunity and not everyone would have the chance to do what I did. I learnt a lot in the competition as we participated in the open category which allowed me to compete with older competitors and also learn from them. Given the opportunity, I would love to represent our school again.”  <br>

The school congratulates Sherry Koh Pan Yi and Amanda Woo Kai Yi for winning the ADAPTATION Award in the 2016 Design & Technology Awards. Their winning artefact will be displayed at The Marquee @ Science Centre Singapore on 1 Jun 2016. To God be the Glory! 

  

**Students' Reflections:**

"During the process of making the artefact, I felt frustrated as we faced many problems. One of the challenges was the motor not being able to work properly and this was the crucial part of the artefact. I was afraid that we could not finish making the product. After many times of trying, we managed to overcome the problem. I was quite nervous during the interview due to the short time given for us to prepare. But I soon eased up as the words just came out naturally. I felt a sense if accomplishment when I heard the good news. We had put in a lot of effort and spent long hours in coming up with the idea and making the product. I feel proud and happy that our hard work had paid off."  <br>
**_Amanda Woo, Sec 3A1_** 

  

"During the process of making the artefact, there were many frustrating moments but I felt a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction whenever we complete parts of the artefact. I felt that our artefact was not good enough when compared to the rest. However, we still did our best in trying to promote our product to the judges. I was thrilled and overjoyed as our hard work paid off in the end."  <br>

**_Andrea Seng, Sec 3B1_** 

  

“As part the IDE robotics challenge, we had a boot camp before the actual day of competition. We learned different things during the boot camp such as how to create different shapes and letters with the programming for the robot. We also managed to program the robot according to the brief provided. I also learnt different things from other groups and I am proud of our achievements.”  <br>
**_Christina Tan, Sec 2.4_**

**_Lee Wen, Sec 3A4_** 

  

“Participating in IDE 2016 was an enriching experience. My group took part in the IDE challenge where we were given certain materials to complete three tasks. With the incredibly limited resources provided, we had to wreck our brains to come up with feasible solutions. Thankfully, we were able to pull through in the end. I am extremely grateful for the chance to participate in such an event.”  <Br>
**_Tan Jia Min, Sec 3A1_** 

  

“Taking part in the IDE Robotics was an extremely fun experience. In the IDE challenge, I had the opportunity to learn from other schools which is very meaningful. I hope I would be able to take part in more of such events.”  <br>

****Students' Reflection:**** 

“Participating in the Lit Fest was an enjoyable and enriching experience. In our preparation for the Unseen Poetry debate, my team had fun analysing the poem ad found it very intellectually stimulating. I am glad to have gotten the chance to meet many writers and listen to their writing tips. Overall, Lit Fest really enhanced my appreciation for Literature as a subject and the English Language.”  <br>
**_– Megan Lew, 3A3_** 

  

“To me, the National Schools Literature Festival is more than a competition. It is a true celebration of the beauty of the English language. It was a joy to listen to many famous Singaporean writers, poets and playwrights as I got to learn things that can't be taught with the classroom walls. I feel truly blessed to have gotten such a wonderful opportunity.”  <br>

****Student's Reflections:**** 

"My experience in this national tournament was definitely an unforgettable one. It was not just the end result of making it to quarter finals and making PL history, but also the process of getting there. Although training was intense and exhausting, I thoroughly enjoyed working with my teammates, discussing rebuttals every second that we got to spend with each other, getting to know each others' strengths and weaknesses. I enjoyed the thrilling experiences of going up against such brilliant opponents and brainstorming the cases in great details. I thank God for our teachers and coach for helping us through such an amazing and enriching experience. I would do it again in a heartbeat, and it is truly a blessing to see our hard work, determination, perseverance and teamwork pay off."  <br>
