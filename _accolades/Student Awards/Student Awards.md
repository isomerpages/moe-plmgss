**Students’ reflections**  
  

“This carnival reminded us that despite the odds seemingly against our favour, it is imperative that we constantly encourage one another to keep each other’s spirit up. We understood how our inattention could lead to our greatest downfall, how our motivation could lead to our greatest glory and how the nuances in our mind-sets and attitude made all the difference.”  

**_Kwek Jia Xuan Tammie, Member of PL B Division Netball Team_**  

![](/images/East%20Zone%20Science%20Fair%202017.jpg)
  
“This was the first carnival where the Sec 2s and 3s played as a team and I felt that this carnival really showed me a lot. Although some of us felt demoralised when we first saw the fixtures as we were in a tough grouping, we made a goal for ourselves and worked towards that goal. Before every single game, everyone made sure they were warmed up well and this showed me that everyone was determined to fight. On the court, for all the opponents we faced, everyone stood strong against them and fought hard. Eventually, we topped the table, winning against the team we at first thought might lose to. There were tears and pressure. The games got tighter but no one backed down, we finally clinched 2nd placing. I was honestly surprised because I never thought we would go this far. This carnival really showed me every teammate’s fighting spirit and how a common goal could bring us so far. We constantly reminded ourselves that we wanted the medal. With our fighting spirit, we worked well together and supported each other. It felt good as I knew that not only me but everyone in my team wanted to win and that was my motivation to put in all my shots. This is a carnival that I would never forget, for all the emotions I felt and what I saw in all of my teammates.”  

_**Gladys Chia Xin Yi, Vice-Captain of the PL B Division Netball team**_  
  
“Since it was my last time playing in speed carnival with my team of Sec 2s and 3s, I wanted our team to do their best and land themselves in the finals. With the team’s goal in mind and the motivation from my teammates, I set my mind on the challenge ahead and to always be focused on what I truly want to achieve at the end. The teams that we were going against were really strong and I was initially worried that my team would be afraid but our team came in strong and had what it takes to win. We maintained our winning streak until that very last match against St Hilda’s Secondary where we fell short by one goal and clinched the silver medal instead. I am still very proud of my team because we worked very hard as a team together and took every game as an opportunity to improve our skills and prove ourselves that we are one PL team. I felt touched to see my teammates working hard and I was very motivated as I knew that I was not working hard for that medal alone. I had my teammates’ assurance and determination as well to push me forward.”  

_**Charisse Lim Xuan Min, Captain of the PL B Division Netball Team**_

**Students’ Reflections**  
  
“This competitions was truly an inspiring and enriching one. It allowed me to test out my knowledge of robotics coding and programming and I have gained so much knowledge from the workshop and the competitions provided. The road ahead was a tough one. We encounter many obstacles that put my team under lots of pressure and not everything went smooth as we expected, even on the competition day itself. With determination and perseverance, we overcame each obstacle one by one until we emerged victorious. This competition has been a great learning opportunity.”  <br>
_**Adelaine Ruth Hanako Suhendro,&nbsp; 2.2**_  
  
“As this was my first time taking part in this competition. Our team had lots of issues in programming our robot as it did not turn out the way we wanted it to be.. However, we did not give up and tried our best to reprogram the codes so that our robot was able to complete the maze. Although our team did not get into the top 3, we were awarded with the best robot design. Through the process of preparation for the competition, I have learnt that no matter what circumstances we encounter, we should never give up and continue to press on till the very end. I also learnt that teamwork is a very important factor for a team as everyone have to work together and do their part in order to achieve the desired goal. Lastly, I realised that winning is not the only important thing to achieve in a competition but exposure and experienced we gained from the competition as well as the friendships forged are the ones that count.”  <br>
_**Sherlynn Yeo, 2.3**_  
  
"This competition has definitely widened my knowledge on technology and robotics and it was a good experience for me and my teammates as we had to get our robot to complete its mission, not giving up even when we faced several challenges."  <br>
_**Natasha Wee, 3A3**_  
  
“Through this competition, I have gained a lot of experience. Having to use the&nbsp;&nbsp; Arduino software for the first time, I had to start right from the basic to learn to program the robot. There were many setbacks in preparation for this competition but all our work had paid off. This is definitely largely due to the great teamwork and resilience in my team and the never ending will to push on to the last second. I'm thankful to the teachers who has made this possible for us students to participate in this competition. This was a great experience for me and one that I'll treasure and learn from in future activities.”  <br>
_**Gladys Cheng, 3A1**_  
  
“The iDigix 3D-tronics competition was a very good experience for me. Through it, I have learnt more about remote controlled robots, made new friends and gained exposure on robotics competitions in Singapore. .”  <br>
_**Janice Khoo, 3A1**_  
  
“Through this competition, I learn about team work and time management. I learnt that we need teamwork to go through this competition because without teamwork things cannot be done. I had fun during the competition and I look forward to future competitions.”  <br>
_**Faith Ng, 2.3**_  
  
“From this competition, I have learnt many things such as teamwork as well as thinking on my two feet. To do well in the competition, I had to work and communicate with my teammates. I also learnt how to control a robot with as well as how metal cannot be in contact a circuit board. We faced a few problems in this competition. However, we learnt how to solve those problems quickly and with the amount of resources we have. I made many friends from the competition and I am very thankful to be given this opportunity.”  <br>
_**Breann Ong, 1.1**_  
  
“Through this competition, I have learnt the importance of teamwork and communication. Through this competition, I have learnt that in order for a group to be successful, everyone MUST play a part in contributing to the team, be it for the presentation or showing up for meetings and adding ideas to better improve the robot.”  <br>
_**Timea Bay, 3B1**_

**Students’ Reflection**  
  
“Overall for this East Zone Competition, I felt happy and grateful that I was given the chance to compete and experience something academic lessons would not be able to give me. I also enjoyed the process of learning, fighting hard, defeat, victory with my teammates and I really treasure each and every one of them even though we don’t see eye to eye sometimes. I learnt many values like sportsmanship, determination, perseverance, and resilience to continue pressing on even if my team is losing. What’s important is that we are safe and have tried our very best, didn’t give up and were there for each other. I also feel that the bonds I have formed with my team will never be broken and we have gotten closer and can open up to each other better. I also think we did well overall and I am thankful that we clinched the top 4 position. This top 4 is for my team, my coaches, my teachers and those who were supporting us and I think we accomplished our goal.”  <br>
**_Karen Siew Ching Yi, Member of PL B Division Netball Team_**  
  
  
“I was privileged to get the opportunity to play many games. We experienced winning and losing games and we did learn a lot more by losing, giving us more and learning how to overcome our problems. As the going gets tough, I really want the team to become more united as one, having the team spirit to fight all the way and go far together.  <br>

**Students' Reflections:** 

“In this competition, our robot had quite a few breakdowns. During the competition itself, the unit faced tough competitions from other competitors. Through teamwork, communication and tolerance, we all managed to pull through, and that is really worth all the effort.”  <br>
**_Wee Chun Hui, 3A1_** 

  

“I feel that participating in this year’s World Robotics Games was definitely an enriching opportunity as I felt that it trained myself mentally and physically into adapting to different changes as well as new challenges to solve. I have learnt a lot from this experience and it has been a great learning opportunity.”  <br>
**_Lee Wen, 3A4_** 

  

“During the two days of the competition we met with many setbacks such as the wheels of the robot falling off or the screws coming lose on various parts of the robot. However, this competition has allowed me to be closer with my team mate, Chun Hui and exposed us to different forms of robotic technologies. When we first walked in for practice, many people from other schools, including parents and teachers looked at us, probably in disbelief. However, as we practiced and got the hang of things together with teamwork and communication, we eventually managed to emerge victorious and made our mark. The sense of satisfaction and euphoria that we felt when we finished the task was truly amazing. The experience has also taught me that nothing is impossible if you set your heart and mind to accomplishing it.”  <br>
**_Ling Yin, 3A1_** 

  

“This competition was a thrilling one compared to previous competitions our robotics unit had participated in. We entered this competition fully prepared but not knowing what the main challenges are. Though some problems came up on the competition day itself, we were able to fix them. Can't wait for our next competition to show other schools that our school can do robotics.”  <br>
**_Woo Jie Lyn, 3A2_** 

  

“As this is my first competition in robotics, I feel very honoured to be selected for participation. The competition gave me a lot of experience and I felt very happy having contributed my best. There were also challenges we faced. We struggled with the speed and tuning of the line tracer. Through this competition, I learnt that teamwork and sportsmanship is very important. Thank you PLMGSS for this experience!” <br>
**_Angel Yip, 1.2_** 

  

“I really enjoyed participating in WRG Singapore as it was a new experience for me. During the competition itself I learnt a lot about teamwork as my partner, Jia Min, and I had to work closely together to ensure that our robot could complete all challenges. I’m really glad I had the chance to take part in this competition along with the rest of the PL Robotics Unit!”  <br>
**_Julia, 3A3_** 

  

### iChef Competition

![](/images/iChef.png)

The NFS unit participated in this year’s ichef competition which was organised by Republic Polytechnic. A total of 3 teams from our PLMGSS participated in the above competition. The teams had to undergo 2 challenges, the first challenge was to create a fusion bento box lunch presentation and the other was to do a menu design for a Café in the qualifying round. A total of 108 teams from various schools participated in the qualifying round. One of our 3 teams, “PL Angels” qualified for the finals. In the finals the teams were to prepare 5 different types of Butler Passed Canapes featuring ingredients from the East to the West ends of the globe. The team practiced hard for the finals and worked diligently to present the canapes attractively. “PL Angels” came in 4 th place in this competition. 

  

**Students' Reflections:***

“The subject, Food and Nutrition, motivated us to cook different types of food. We are inspired and challenged to cook different type of interesting food. The creation of the menu, the process of brainstorming for the bento box and the workshops that we attended during the first round of competition had given us an eye opening experience. We never knew food can be infused and created in such a way. Through this competition we learned that teamwork and communication skills are important life skills in the working life. We have to learn how to communicate and work in a group to get things done. We sat down as a team to talk about the problems. As we talked and brainstormed, we found solutions to our problems and sometimes we can be very creative in our solutions.”  <br>

### PL ‘C’ Division Volleyball Team Makes History

![](/images/C%20Div%20Volleyball.png)

8 years after PL first established the Volleyball team, the PL ‘C’ Division Volleyball Team finally made history by clinching 3 d position in the East Zone ‘C’ Division Volleyball Championships and qualified for the nationals. The Volleyball girls trained 3 times a week and took part in a number of competitions to prepare themselves. During the East Zone ‘C’ Division Volleyball Championships 2016, the girls displayed great resilience to overcome injuries and illnesses and managed to beat some traditionally strong teams. The Volleyball girls will continue to put in their best effort during the nationals to bring honour to the school. 

  

**Students' Reflections:**

"To achieve something no one had ever achieved before in this school during our school’s 100 th anniversary is definitely unforgettable. I have learnt to push myself beyond my boundaries and always to persevere. Also, I have learnt the importance of teamwork and team spirit. I am looking forward to more of these experiences to come!"  <br>
**_Yap Jing Yi, Nadia, Vice-Captain of the PL C Division Volleyball Team_** 

  

"On the first day of the competition, we were surprised that we managed to beat our strong opponent despite playing the match immediately after our Sec 2 Camp. What was even more unimaginable was that we actually reached the nationals. This was beyond my expectations and it will be an experience I can never forget."  <br>
**_Faith Andreali M. Bunoan, team member of the PL C Division Volleyball Team_** 

  

### iDigix 3D-Tronics Challenge @ Labs 2016

![](/images/idigix.png)

The iDigix 3D-Tronics Challenge @ Labs 2016 is a competition that encourages students to think out of the box, develop problem solving and applied learning skills. It also allows team spirit among participation and learning through meaningful experiences. 

  

The challenge is designed to enable students to hone their skills in robotics programming, as well as to 3D-printing technology can come into place to solve or enhance the design of the robot and performance function. In addition, the theme of "Upcycling" is introduced for 2016's competition. Teams can also put their creativity to test by making use of recyclables to build their robots, transforming the recycled or unused materials at home into other useful applications. 

  

We are proud to announce that one team comprising of Woo Jie Lyn of 3A2, Charissa Wee of Sec 2.2 and Angel Yip of Sec 1.1 won the 2 nd Runner Up position in the Maze Explorer Senior Category. In the Arena Battle Open Category, our robotic girls Lee Wen of Sec 3A4, Andrea Seng of 3B1 and Christina Tan of Sec 2.4 were the champions defeating other competitors from institute of higher learning. Congratulation to the Robotic Teams of PLMGSS! 

  

**Students' Reflections: **

“Going for the 3D-tronics Challenge was a wonderful experience for me. In the competition, there were many people of different ages taking part in different categories with different styles. The competition made us step out of our comfort zones to learn from others and improve from there. I would like to thank our Principal Mrs Quek and our teacher Mr Indra for giving us the chance to broaden our knowledge about robotics by attending such competitions. I hope I will be able to attend more of such competitions in the future.”  <br>
**_Charissa Wee, 2.2_** 

  

“I feel that participating in this year’s 3D-Tronics Challenge was definitely an enriching opportunity as I felt that it trained me mentally and physically to adapt to different challenges during the Arena Battle games as well as having to think independently to solve new problems. I have learnt a lot from this experience and I am very thankful for this great learning opportunity.”  <br>
**_Lee Wen, 3A4_** 

  

“This competition was once again a challenge with the new category and tough program coding. We were all afraid that our robot may not work and we will not be able to make the school proud. We worked together to figure out all the problems with whatever tools available. This competition once again provided me with very enjoyable times that I can spend working together with my teammates.”  <br>
**_Woo Jie Lyn, 3A2_** 

  

“Taking part in the 2016 3D-tronics Challenge was very interesting especially when the challenges were different from last year. This year, my team and I entered the battle robot category and clinched champion position. I am proud of my team as we competed against institutes of higher learning such as the ITE. Through this competition, I managed to have more patience and strategise the movement for my robots depending on the situations. I am extremely thankful for the opportunity to take part in this year's 3D-tronics Challenge. I would like to thank our teacher-in-charge, Mr Indra, for guiding us through this competition and for giving us opportunities to take part in competitions and do the school proud.”  <br>
**_Andrea Seng, 3B1_** 

  

“This competition gave me a great opportunity to train up my focus. We needed to be focused and not get distracted by the people around us. We persevered to prepare the robot for the competition through Arduino Programming. I am happy that we were the 2nd runner up for the competition and hope to win more prizes for the school.”  <br>
**_Angel Yip, 1.1_** 

  

“I felt honoured as it is a rare opportunity and not everyone would have the chance to do what I did. I learnt a lot in the competition as we participated in the open category which allowed me to compete with older competitors and also learn from them. Given the opportunity, I would love to represent our school again.”  <br>

The school congratulates Sherry Koh Pan Yi and Amanda Woo Kai Yi for winning the ADAPTATION Award in the 2016 Design & Technology Awards. Their winning artefact will be displayed at The Marquee @ Science Centre Singapore on 1 Jun 2016. To God be the Glory! 

  

**Students' Reflections:**

"During the process of making the artefact, I felt frustrated as we faced many problems. One of the challenges was the motor not being able to work properly and this was the crucial part of the artefact. I was afraid that we could not finish making the product. After many times of trying, we managed to overcome the problem. I was quite nervous during the interview due to the short time given for us to prepare. But I soon eased up as the words just came out naturally. I felt a sense if accomplishment when I heard the good news. We had put in a lot of effort and spent long hours in coming up with the idea and making the product. I feel proud and happy that our hard work had paid off."  <br>
**_Amanda Woo, Sec 3A1_** 

  

"During the process of making the artefact, there were many frustrating moments but I felt a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction whenever we complete parts of the artefact. I felt that our artefact was not good enough when compared to the rest. However, we still did our best in trying to promote our product to the judges. I was thrilled and overjoyed as our hard work paid off in the end."  <br>
**_Sheryl Koh, Sec 3A4_**

**_Christina Tan, Sec 2.4_** 

  

“I feel that participating in this year’s IDE challenge was definitely an enriching opportunity as I felt that it had trained my mental and physical stamina, adaptability and flexibility to overcome problems and challenges. It was certainly been a great learning experience.”  <Br>
**_Lee Wen, Sec 3A4_** 

  

“Participating in IDE 2016 was an enriching experience. My group took part in the IDE challenge where we were given certain materials to complete three tasks. With the incredibly limited resources provided, we had to wreck our brains to come up with feasible solutions. Thankfully, we were able to pull through in the end. I am extremely grateful for the chance to participate in such an event.”  <Br>
**_Tan Jia Min, Sec 3A1_** 

  

“Taking part in the IDE Robotics was an extremely fun experience. In the IDE challenge, I had the opportunity to learn from other schools which is very meaningful. I hope I would be able to take part in more of such events.”  <br>

### Innovation, Design & Engineering (IDE) Challenge 2015

![](/images/IDE%202015.png)

The Innovation, Design and Engineering (IDE) Challenge, which took place on 20 March 2015, was a hands-on competition with one or more engineering challenges. Participating teams were required to work on their designs and solutions. On the actual day of competition, teams needed to create the most effective design under limited time using the materials provided to them. 

  

We are proud to announce that one of the teams representing PLMGS (Sec) clinched the IDE Engineering Award for 2015. The members comprised Zaneta Low and Tan Jia Min, both from Sec 2.3. 

  

****Students' Reflections:**** 

“ I feel that this competition was absolutely fun and brain-triggering. In our normal lessons, we sit down, take notes and sometimes have group work, but in this competition, my team and I really pushed our brain to try to win something. Overall, this competition was fun, and was made even more so with my awesome team-mates. Thank you for giving us this opportunity.” 

**_from Wee Chun Hui, Sec 2.2_** 

  

“The IDE Challenge 2015 was a wonderful learning experience. It certainly got us wrecking our brains, trying to think of a way around each challenge considering the impossibly little resources given for the construction of all three contraptions. IDE was definitely something different from any other typical competition, and I am glad I had the opportunity to participate in such an event.”  <br>
**_from Tan Jia Min, Sec 2.3_** 

  

“To be honest, when the team leaders asked me to join them, I wasn’t sure what they saw in me. I was a little shocked. Through research and all the team meetings, I became more confident about the competition. When we went into the competition with zero expectations, although we covered quite a lot of content in research. The competition was intense but overall I enjoyed the entire process of planning and making the objects. Although some artefacts may not have turned out as well as expected, I guess it was the journey that counts. I enjoyed myself throughout the entire process”  <br>
**_from Ling Yin, Sec 2.2_** 

  

“Being part of this competition has taught me how to think on my feet. After completing my bridge, I realized that it could not hold heavy weights as well as expected. Therefore, I had to quickly plan and build a second one. Despite having their own tasks, my team mates stood by me and helped me by contributing ideas.”  <br>
**_from Crystal Cheong, Sec 2.2_** 

  

“I am really glad that I was able to participate in the IDE Championship 2015. The tasks that we were supposed to perform were really challenging and thought-provoking. The task that we found most challenging was building the rubber band powered car and the easiest one was building the bridge. I am really happy that my team members did their part and we all managed to put our strengths to use. Other than learning more about Innovation, Design and Engineering, I am glad that I learnt values like adaptability more in depth through the limit of materials and time provided.”  <br>
**_from Julia, Sec 2.3_** 

  

“The IDE challenge was an interesting and fun competition. In the competition, we were given limited materials to satisfy three challenges: to build a strong bridge, an efficient rubber band powered car and a structure to protect 10 eggs when dropped from a height of three floors. We were able to learn a lot through trial and error and also able to have fun in the process. It was very eventful and I would definitely like to participate again if I were given another chance.”  <br>
**_from Esther Chew, Sec 2.2._**

**_Syaza Nisrina, Sec 4A3, President of PL Photography Club_** 

  

I feel that the Canon EOS Academy magazine is a great platform for photographers to learn from one another. We learnt to get the techniques right and master the skills for a specific genre of photography. It also gives the photographers the recognition they deserve for the effort they put into taking each photo. I have learnt a lot from different photographers from other schools and I am also very inspired to continue sharing my photos with others. It is indeed an honour to have my photo published in a renowned magazine.  <br>

****Students' Reflections:**** 

The KC Humanities/NE Challenge not only allowed us to put our textbook knowledge to use, but it also tested us on current events, making us more aware of what is happening in the world. We had a lot of fun taking part in the competition and also learnt things that are not taught in the classroom. Although the challenge was tough at times, we persevered and supported each other to do our best. <br>
**_Sarah-Ann Lim, Sec 4A2_** 

  

I learned a lot from the taking part in the competition: both team work and knowledge. The Humanities Challenge comprised mainly of History and general knowledge questions. Thus, it is important to be updated and well informed with the latest news happening all around the world. We must work well and be united as a team in order to overcome the challenges faced when participating in the various tasks. All in all, I enjoyed myself during the KC Humanities Challenge and I am very grateful to have had such an opportunity to participate. <br>

****Student's Reflections:**** 

“ The 37 th C. B. Paul Science Quiz was really an eye opener. I was apprehensive at first.I was surprised when I passed the preliminary round to move on to the final and achieved a bronze medal! Personally I think the questions were challenging and tough, especially the chemistry and biology questions. Thankfully, I managed to brave through the application questions. The competition was a really great experience for me, as I was exposed to various, unique, think-on-the-spot questions. It gave me an opportunity to learn that sciences and math are something beyond the textbooks .”  <br>
**_from Ignasia Hanny, Secondary 4A1 (Bronze Individual Award)_** 

  

“ I really liked the exposure, especially the biology questions! The questions really were something that I've never seen before and they intrigued me. Even though the questions were really quite hard, especially since some of them were not for secondary school level, I had a very enjoyable time! They made me think out of the box. I continued to wonder and research about some of the topics even after the quiz was over .”  <br>
**_from Hannah Quek, Secondary 3A1_** 

  

“ This being my first C.B. Paul Science Quiz, I have to say it has been a valuable experience. The questions that were asked were out of my syllabus, but I have to say that I am happy I was able to answer some of them. Being a Secondary 2 student, I am glad that I was able to be exposed to such questions that are out of my syllabus. I am also thankful that I could participate in a competition like this and represent the school and give God the Glory !”  <br>

### The spirit of enterprise rolls on in PL!

![](/images/spirit%20of%20enterprise%20rolls%20on%20PL.png)

Six dedicated PL-lites from Class 3D1 represented PLMGSS in the finals of the National Pushcart Challenge 2014 organised by Republic Polytechnic. This competition required teams to collaborate with a social enterprise of their choice and develop product innovations to augment their existing merchandise for fund-raising. 

  

Working with the SPCA, our girls saw an opportunity in recycling unwanted cardboard rolls into household products such as photo frames, stationery holders, torchlights, desktop lamps and even mobile phone speakers! 

  

After a long 5 months’ work involving ideation, sourcing and development, the girls had to set up their own pushcart to market their completed products at Causeway Point over 2 days. 

  

Their hard work and aching feet eventually paid much dividends as they snagged the Most Innovative Product award as well as the overall 1 st runners-up trophy – the only team out of 16 finalists to receive 2 prizes! 

  

The school congratulates Faith Kung, P. Maitreyah, Pan YiTong, Raeann Tan, Saraniya D/O Panichelvam and Theenmathi D/O Kanesan (all from 3D1) for their unique achievement! 

  

****Students' Reflections:**** 

"This experience proved how important teamwork is as we stuck together throughout the competition, coming to school and working on the products even during the holidays." 

**_\- Raeann Tan_** 

  

"It’s fantastic how we managed to get so many of our products out in time! The key was in how we split the workload and helped one another out." 

**_\- Theenmathi_** 

  

"Through this competition, I’ve learnt much about taking personal responsibility, how to overcome my fear of approaching strangers and lastly, the importance of working with others. These experiences will make me a better person!" 

**_\- P. Maitreyah_**

“This Ace Science project was extremely enriching and taught me to think out of the box. Through the project, I have learnt to persevere and understood the meaning of commitment even more as we had to invest time and effort into finding information and putting it together to finish our research paper. The Science Fair held in Victoria Junior College was an eye-opener. There were many different project titles and it showed me that science is in our everyday lives and it can be interesting after all. It has changed my perception on what science is all about.”  <br>
**_from Michelle Seet Su Ling, Secondary 2.1_** 

  

“The ACE Science project required a lot of commitment including going back to school during the holidays, weeks of researching and editing of our research paper, and repeating the experiment to ensure fairness and accuracy. However, when the project was finally done and ready for presentation, I felt quite proud of our project as it was the result of our few months of hard work. Even though we did not win the competition, it was is a great one-time experience, and I am glad that I did not give up.”  <br>
**_from Bethany Lim, Secondary 2.1_** 

  

“Through this East Zone Science Fair, I have learnt that it required commitment and efforts in science experiments. Time management was also important because even though we had half a year to complete, coming up with an experiment to work on was not easy. We had to go through 2 experiments which were both unsuccessful and not so interesting before coming up with our final experiment. Our final experiment required us to filter the dried leaves and saw dust out from the solutions one by one, 54 times across 3 days. To make sure that the experiment was fair, it should be repeated more than once. In addition, I had to analyse and compare results to ensure that the hypothesis was correct. Overall, it was a good and fun learning experience.”  <br>

****Student's Reflection**** 

“O-Level Art is so much more than a subject to me. It has allowed me to express myself and my perspective of the world around me in ways I could never have imagined. Though the process of completing the coursework was tiring, and has at times raised doubts and hopelessness within me, God's love and grace never fails. Christ is the centre of my coursework and my sole inspiration. I have truly seen the glory of Christ through this experience that has been like no others. I urge the juniors who are to take on Art at O-Level - never doubt your abilities, for when the Lord is with you, anything is possible. It has been the most amazing journey and one I will always remember. Thank you, PL, for believing in me when I least did in myself.”  <br>

### 36th C.B. Paul Memorial Science Quiz

![](/images/36th%20CB%20Paul%20Science%20Quiz.png)

On 26 January 2014, nine Secondary Two ACE Science pupils participated in the 36 th C.B. Paul Memorial Science Quiz organized by ACJC Science and Mathematics Council. The annual science quiz aims to provide a platform for students to apply textbook knowledge in explaining daily phenomena, and hence enabling them to exercise analytical and critical thinking skills. 

  

The students were put through rigorous questions in a wide range of contexts including Astronomy, Biology, Chemistry, Computer Science, Mathematics and Physics. They were challenged to solve problems, evaluate theories, and interpret work which required them to draw on a complex array of understandings. 

  

We are proud to announce that the following students have done the school proud: 

*   Elisabeth Lian Shi-Ri, Secondary 2.1 (Bronze Individual Award)  
    
*   Charis Chia, Secondary 2.3 (Bronze Individual Award)  
    
*   Michelle Seet Su Ling, Secondary 2.1 (Merit Individual Award)  
    

  

****Pupils' Reflections:**** 

“After speaking to my seniors, I knew that the competition was going to be very tough and I was not counting on winning anything. The paper was indeed very tough but it was fun nonetheless. I think it was good knowing where I stand, and it was a great exposure beyond the syllabus. I would really want to do it again in the future.”  <br>
**_Elisabeth Lian Shi-Ri, Secondary 2.1 (Bronze Individual Award)_** 

  

“I felt that the competition was very interesting and it was a good exposure. To be honest, the papers that we took were really tough. I actually got a shock because I have never been exposed to such questions before despite the preparation I had for this competition. Nonetheless, I believe this was a good time for me to actually try out my skills. From this competition, I learnt many sophisticated things, including new topics such as astronomy and computer science. I think that the school should continue to send the Secondary 2 girls for the competition as it actually will give them exposure to the different sciences apart from the three sciences that we learn in school.”  <br>
**_Charis Chia, Secondary 2.3 (Bronze Individual Award)_** 

  

“I feel that the competition was extremely good exposure, especially for computer science and astronomy. It was very intellectually stimulating but tiring at the same time. Overall I think it was a very enriching experience that higher ability science girls should go for.”  <br>
**_Hannah Quek , Secondary 2.1_** 

  

“I think it's a really a good exposure for me as the competition provided a wide range of questions for us to try. The questions asked during the competition were above our level, and I look forward to such a challenge.”  <br>

### PL wins gold medal at the National Inter-School Cross Country Championship 2014

![](/images/inter-school%20cross%20country%20championship%202014.png)

The PL Track and Field team participated in the 55th National Inter-School Cross Country Championships on 25 March 2014 at the Bedok Reservoir where one of our students, Soh Hann Natalie, from Secondary 4A1 won the Gold Medal in the "B" Division category. She ran the 3.6 km route with a timing of 14mins 28.07secs. We would like to thank the coach of the PL Track and Field team, Mr Alfred Sim, for helping the girls to achieve the excellent results. 

  

There is an online newspaper article on this event reported by Today newspaper (26/03/2014). Here is an excerpt of the article: 

  

Natalie Soh of Paya Lebar Methodist Girls’ School Secondary delivered a surprise come-from-behind victory in the Girls ‘B’ Division race, as the gutsy 16-year-old held on to push past her rivals in the last 50m to claim the gold in 14min 28.7sec ahead of Nah Yi Xin (Cedar Girls’) and Shervon Goh (Commonwealth), who finished second and third respectively in 14:30.2 and 14:39.2. 

  

“It was quite a struggle for me when I started the race as everyone was sprinting and I was still trying to get into the rhythm,” said the Secondary Four student, who finished 40th last year. “I wasn’t in the front and I struggled to keep up with them. Towards the end, I thought I would be okay with third, but at the end the two runners in front went faster and I kept up and overtook them in the last 50m. I certainly was the underdog and winning this feels great. It’s amazing, and I still can’t believe I won!” 

On 26 March 2014, The New Paper carried an article on Natalie Soh from Sec 4A1.

****Pupil's Reflection:**** 

"After hours of restless anticipation, the starting horn finally sounded and I kept close to the front of the pack. I was slowly burning out; that was when I drew strength from God to carry me through the race. His greatness surpassed my expectations by giving me that last dose of determination to sprint to the finish. All glory goes to Him and I really thank the school for providing me with this opportunity. Especially the teachers-in-charge, Ms Haida, Ms Tan and Ms Deepa, and of course the PL Track Team for their constant support. Thank you!"  <br>
