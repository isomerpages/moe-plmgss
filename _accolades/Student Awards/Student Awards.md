**Students’ reflections**  
  

“This carnival reminded us that despite the odds seemingly against our favour, it is imperative that we constantly encourage one another to keep each other’s spirit up. We understood how our inattention could lead to our greatest downfall, how our motivation could lead to our greatest glory and how the nuances in our mind-sets and attitude made all the difference.”  

**_Kwek Jia Xuan Tammie, Member of PL B Division Netball Team_**  

![](/images/East%20Zone%20Science%20Fair%202017.jpg)
  
“This was the first carnival where the Sec 2s and 3s played as a team and I felt that this carnival really showed me a lot. Although some of us felt demoralised when we first saw the fixtures as we were in a tough grouping, we made a goal for ourselves and worked towards that goal. Before every single game, everyone made sure they were warmed up well and this showed me that everyone was determined to fight. On the court, for all the opponents we faced, everyone stood strong against them and fought hard. Eventually, we topped the table, winning against the team we at first thought might lose to. There were tears and pressure. The games got tighter but no one backed down, we finally clinched 2nd placing. I was honestly surprised because I never thought we would go this far. This carnival really showed me every teammate’s fighting spirit and how a common goal could bring us so far. We constantly reminded ourselves that we wanted the medal. With our fighting spirit, we worked well together and supported each other. It felt good as I knew that not only me but everyone in my team wanted to win and that was my motivation to put in all my shots. This is a carnival that I would never forget, for all the emotions I felt and what I saw in all of my teammates.”  

_**Gladys Chia Xin Yi, Vice-Captain of the PL B Division Netball team**_  
  
“Since it was my last time playing in speed carnival with my team of Sec 2s and 3s, I wanted our team to do their best and land themselves in the finals. With the team’s goal in mind and the motivation from my teammates, I set my mind on the challenge ahead and to always be focused on what I truly want to achieve at the end. The teams that we were going against were really strong and I was initially worried that my team would be afraid but our team came in strong and had what it takes to win. We maintained our winning streak until that very last match against St Hilda’s Secondary where we fell short by one goal and clinched the silver medal instead. I am still very proud of my team because we worked very hard as a team together and took every game as an opportunity to improve our skills and prove ourselves that we are one PL team. I felt touched to see my teammates working hard and I was very motivated as I knew that I was not working hard for that medal alone. I had my teammates’ assurance and determination as well to push me forward.”  

_**Charisse Lim Xuan Min, Captain of the PL B Division Netball Team**_

The iDigix 3D-Tronics Robotics Challenge 2017 is a competition that encourages students to think out of the box, develop problem solving and applied learning skills. It also inculcates team spirit among participants and&nbsp;learning through meaningful experiences.

The challenge is designed to enable students to hone&nbsp;their skills in robotics programming as well as prototyping robots to performance certain functions. Teams can also put their creativity to test by&nbsp;making&nbsp;use of recyclable materials to build their robots, transforming the recycle materials into useful applications.

We are proud to announce that following winners:

**Students’ Reflections**  
  
“This competitions was truly an inspiring and enriching one. It allowed me to test out my knowledge of robotics coding and programming and I have gained so much knowledge from the workshop and the competitions provided. The road ahead was a tough one. We encounter many obstacles that put my team under lots of pressure and not everything went smooth as we expected, even on the competition day itself. With determination and perseverance, we overcame each obstacle one by one until we emerged victorious. This competition has been a great learning opportunity.”  <br>
_**Adelaine Ruth Hanako Suhendro,&nbsp; 2.2**_  
  
“As this was my first time taking part in this competition. Our team had lots of issues in programming our robot as it did not turn out the way we wanted it to be.. However, we did not give up and tried our best to reprogram the codes so that our robot was able to complete the maze. Although our team did not get into the top 3, we were awarded with the best robot design. Through the process of preparation for the competition, I have learnt that no matter what circumstances we encounter, we should never give up and continue to press on till the very end. I also learnt that teamwork is a very important factor for a team as everyone have to work together and do their part in order to achieve the desired goal. Lastly, I realised that winning is not the only important thing to achieve in a competition but exposure and experienced we gained from the competition as well as the friendships forged are the ones that count.”  <br>
_**Sherlynn Yeo, 2.3**_  
  
"This competition has definitely widened my knowledge on technology and robotics and it was a good experience for me and my teammates as we had to get our robot to complete its mission, not giving up even when we faced several challenges."  <br>
_**Natasha Wee, 3A3**_  
  
“Through this competition, I have gained a lot of experience. Having to use the&nbsp;&nbsp; Arduino software for the first time, I had to start right from the basic to learn to program the robot. There were many setbacks in preparation for this competition but all our work had paid off. This is definitely largely due to the great teamwork and resilience in my team and the never ending will to push on to the last second. I'm thankful to the teachers who has made this possible for us students to participate in this competition. This was a great experience for me and one that I'll treasure and learn from in future activities.”  <br>
_**Gladys Cheng, 3A1**_  
  
“The iDigix 3D-tronics competition was a very good experience for me. Through it, I have learnt more about remote controlled robots, made new friends and gained exposure on robotics competitions in Singapore. .”  <br>
_**Janice Khoo, 3A1**_  
  
“Through this competition, I learn about team work and time management. I learnt that we need teamwork to go through this competition because without teamwork things cannot be done. I had fun during the competition and I look forward to future competitions.”  <br>
_**Faith Ng, 2.3**_  
  
“From this competition, I have learnt many things such as teamwork as well as thinking on my two feet. To do well in the competition, I had to work and communicate with my teammates. I also learnt how to control a robot with as well as how metal cannot be in contact a circuit board. We faced a few problems in this competition. However, we learnt how to solve those problems quickly and with the amount of resources we have. I made many friends from the competition and I am very thankful to be given this opportunity.”  <br>
_**Breann Ong, 1.1**_  
  
“Through this competition, I have learnt the importance of teamwork and communication. Through this competition, I have learnt that in order for a group to be successful, everyone MUST play a part in contributing to the team, be it for the presentation or showing up for meetings and adding ideas to better improve the robot.”  <br>
