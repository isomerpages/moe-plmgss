**PL LEAD – EVERY PL-LITE AN INSPIRING LEADER**  

PL Lead is a key management system of PLMGS (Sec)’s Character Development (CD) focus. Our approach to student leadership is to equip students with the necessary values, knowledge and skills through leadership workshops and camps and thereafter to empower them for their roles or to make a positive and impactful difference to those around them.&nbsp;  

  

PL Lead, has established a comprehensive system to explore, develop and maximise the leadership potential of all PL-Lites. This stems from our belief that  

-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Every student can be developed as a leader  
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Every student should be developed as a leader  
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Development must be intentional  
  
**Student Leadership Framework**  

The PL student Leadership Framework is represented in the form of a lighthouse to remind PL-Lites that they are to be a light to the community. They are to be examples in speech, in life, in love, in faith and in purity (I Tim 4:12).

Activities at each student leadership developmental stage, (starting with Personal, followed by Peer and ending with People) is age appropriate, with a focus on the themes of “I Discover” (Sec 1), “I Aspire” (Sec 2), “I Influence” (Sec 3) and “I Inspire” (Sec 4/5) as a leadership focus.&nbsp;  
  
**Leadership Training**  

Every PL-Lite will be equipped with basic leadership skills through the leadership modules conducted yearly from Secondary 1 (Leadership 101), Secondary 2 (Leadership 201) and Secondary 3 (Leadership 301).&nbsp; In addition, every student will have the opportunity to apply the values, knowledge and skills learnt through their leadership roles at class, CCA or school level.
