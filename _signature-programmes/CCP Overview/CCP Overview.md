### Co-curricular Programme (CCP) Overview

The Total Curriculum in PLMGS (Sec) comprises the Curriculum and the Co-Curriculum. Through the Total Curriculum, we seek to nurture our students holistically into ‘whole persons’ which as stated in our Mission. By this, we mean our students develop holistically in the moral, cognitive, social-emotional, physical and aesthetic domains.  
  
The Co-Curriculum complements the Curriculum. It consists of and provides students with experiential learning opportunities through programmes in:  
(a) Co-Curricular Activities (CCA)  
(b) Values in Action (VIA)  
(c) Student Leadership Development (SLD)  
(d) Enrichment and Life-skills (ENL)  
  
The PLMGS (Sec) Co-Curriculum Framework was conceptualised in 2009 and reviewed and further refined in Nov 2015 to summarise the approach and implementation of CCP in the school.

### Our Beliefs

  
1.    The co-curriculum is integral to the holistic development of students.  
  
2.   Through the co-curriculum, students are provided with **varied** and **authentic opportunities** to develop their **values** and **character** into a whole person in line with our mission. Learning that spans across the co-curricular programmes include our school **HEART** values, **social-emotional competencies** and the emerging **21st century competencies**.

3.    With **experiential learning** as its main delivery mode, learning in the co-curriculum must be **intentional**. The quality of the learning process is key to achieving the learning outcomes. Learning is based largely on **action** (Head and Hands engagement) and **reflection** (Head and Heart engagement) and can occur in a range of environments and situations - whether students are serving the community, organising a school event as a student leader, or in the field of competition or the performing stage.  
  

### Guiding Principles  

The following principles guide staff on the planning and implementation of the co-curriculum:  

1.    Provide breadth of experiences  
There should be a range and variety of programmes and activities to cater for holistic development and to broaden students’ learning. The range of programmes and activities should support students’ interests and promote self-directedness in learning.  
  
2.    Ensure development and progression  
The activities and learning experiences should be designed to deepen students’ development of knowledge and skills and be purposefully planned to support development of character, leadership, citizenship and achievement of the 21st century student outcomes.  
  
3.    Provide challenge and enjoyment  
While the pursuit of excellence is important, the programmes and activities should provide a healthy balance of collaboration and allow for participation at different levels to promote students’ overall enjoyment.  
  
4.    Promote social bonding and integration  
The programmes and activities should present opportunities for building friendships and allow students to work as a team towards a common goal. They should promote social integration and cohesion.   
  
5.    Consider available resources and safety  
In the planning and implementation of the programmes and activities, schools should also consider availability of resources such as manpower and physical facilities, and the ability to ensure safety in their delivery.  
 
### Learning Outcomes  

1.    PLMGS (Sec) Co-Curriculum Framework is derived from the MOE’s 21st Century Competencies Framework and Student Outcomes which constitute the broader learning outcomes.  
  
2.    The Co-Curriculum works towards achieving the following level outcomes:

*   _**Sec 1: i Discover**_ \- PL-Lites discover their self identities, personalities, talents, interests and citizenship.
*   _**Sec 2: i Aspire**_ \- PL-Lites aspire to fulfil their roles and responsibilities in the areas of family, school, community  
    and nation.
*   _**Sec 3: i Influence**_ \- PL-Lites influence the people around them positively.
*   _**Sec 4/5: i Inspire**_ \- PL-Lites inspire others by being an informed citizen and active servant leader.

### Implementation of the CC Framework in PLMGS (Sec) through the PL CC Management systems

1.    **PL LiVE** - PL LiVE covers the formal CCE (Character & Citizenship) Curriculum content of our character development programme. The CCE Curriculum content is premised on the three big ideas of Identity, Relationships and Choices and anchored on the teaching of core values and social-emotional competencies. To help students find a sense of purpose, these fundamentals are taught and applied in the following curriculum content areas:  
  

a) National Education  <br>
b) Sexuality Education <br>  
c) Mental Health  <br>
d) Education and Career Guidance  <br>
e) Cyber Wellness  <br>
f) Family Education  
  
2.    **PL Reach** - PL Reach is our Values in Action programme based on the Service-Learning model, named Faithful-in-Service (FIS). FIS aims to equip our PL-Lites with the relevant knowledge and skills to instil in them good values and attitudes while meeting authentic home, community, national and global needs.  
  
3.    **PL Home** - PL Home comprises programmes that cultivate a sense of active citizenry in our students so that they will be rooted to Singapore, have a strong civic consciousness, are informed, and take an active role in bettering the lives of others around them. This is done through organising the commemorative activities for: (a) the 4 National Education (NE) days - Total Defence Day (Feb), International Friendship Day (Apr), Racial Harmony Day (Jul) and National Day (Aug), (b) Uniform Group Days - NPCC day (May), St John Brigade day (Jun), Girls’ Brigade day (Jul) and (c) other national NE events such as the Singapore Kindness Week (Jul).  
  
4.   **PL Lead** - PL Lead comprises programmes organised to explore, develop and maximise the leadership potential of all PL-Lites. The goal is to develop each student into an Inspiring Leader who is an active contributor, able to work effectively in teams, exercises initiative, takes calculated risks, is innovative and strives for excellence. The programmes are aligned to the Leadership Challenge Model by Kouzes and Posner1 . As leaders, students are trained to (a) model the way, (b) inspire a Shared Vision, (c) challenge the Process, (d) enable others to act and (e) encourage the heart.  
  
5.    **PL Aesthetics** - Leveraging PL’s appointment as the East Zone Centre of Excellence for the Creative Arts (COECA), PL Aesthetics programmes aim to stretch the high-ability students with an interest and talent in the Arts and Aesthetics. This is a talent development programme which looks into the three main areas of (a) Instructional Programme, (b) Co-Curricular Programme and (c) school-wide Enrichment Programme to develop students in their talents and to spread the love for the Aesthetics to the whole school population.    
  
6.    **PL Health** - PL Health comprises programmes which promotes the holistic health of our students in the areas of physical, mental, social and emotional and spiritual health. Key platforms in PL Health programmes are the Physical Education curriculum, the Co-Curricular activities (CCA) programme where all students take up a CCA for a period of 4/5 years and the empowering of student leaders in health promotion amongst their peers.  
  
7.    **PL Transform** - PL Transform comprises programmes to help our students learn from their mistakes and grow in their character. Teachers in the team use the 4 ‘R’s approach to guide our students in recognising their mistakes, making restitution for their mistakes, having reconciliation with the people who have been affected by their action and making resolution to not make the same mistake again.  
  
8.    **PL Care** - PL Care comprises programmes that build positive teacher-student Relationships while looking into the well-being of the students. The planning of the programmes begins with identification of needs of the various segments of students. This needs analysis is done through FGD, profiling tools and surveys. Thereafter, the data is analysed and appropriate care and support will be provided for them. PL Care includes early intervention programmes and counselling for students and programmes that support financially-needy students with MOE and school-based financial assistance schemes.  
  
The International Students Integration Committee looks into promoting social integration and enabling both local students and those of other nationalities to learn to relate to one another by:  
•    assisting new international students to adjust to life and studies in Singapore  
•    helping local and international students to appreciate cultural differences and diversity  
•    creating opportunities for local students and international students to foster mutual trust and friendships based on shared interests, experiences and common values.
