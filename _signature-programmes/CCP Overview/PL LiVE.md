**Background of the Programme**

PL places a strong emphasis on Character & Citizenship Education as we aim to develop our PL-Lites into women of fine character with a passion for life and learning.

PL LiVE covers the formal curriculum of our character development programme. The curriculum is carried out mainly through our **Li**feskills and **V**alues **E**ducation (LiVE) lessons and enrichment programmes.

  
**Goals of CCE 2021**

In alignment with CCE 2021, we aim to develop in our students:

*   **Good character**: to be anchored in sound values, think critically and ethically, make discerning judgement and take responsibility for their choices and actions.
    *   By inculcating the PL HEART values (Honour God, Excellence, Adaptability, Respect, Thankfulness) and building the SE and 21st Century Competencies, so as to develop our students into Confident PL-Lites, Passionate Learners, Active Citizens and Inspiring Leaders (PL Desired Outcomes of Education).
*   **Resilience and well-being**: to remain resilient when facing challenges, able to form healthy relationships and have a sense of gratitude which will contribute to their well-being.
*   **Active citizenship**: to contribute to the people around them and the nation.
*   **Future readiness**: to have a sense of purpose in their lives and be equipped to take on the challenges of the future.

**CCE 2021 Curriculum Framework**

The curriculum content of CCE is based on the three big ideas of Identity, Relationships and Choices. It involves the teaching and learning of core values and social-emotional competencies with a focus on developing a sense of purpose in our students. These fundamentals are taught and applied in the six curriculum content areas of CCE. The six content areas are National Education (NE), Sexuality Education (SEd), Mental Health (MH), Education and Career Guidance (ECG), Cyber Wellness (CW) and Family Education (FE).  
  
**_A holistic approach to CCE involves explicit teaching, and reinforcement and application of learning._** Multiple learning platforms are tapped on to help students internalise values, social-emotional competencies, and citizenship dispositions. These platforms include **CCE Lessons, key Student Development Experiences (SDE), and school-based initiatives**.

**Structure of the Programme (Programmes and Processes)**

**LiVE (CCE) lessons**

LiVE lessons are conducted on a weekly basis, and form teachers act as facilitators to lead in classroom discussions on the five of the content areas of CCE. Specially selected and trained teachers will conduct the LiVE lessons on Sexuality Education.

**Mental Health**  <br>
Mental Health is taught explicitly in these CCE topics:

*   Strengthening resilience and well-being (e.g. facing challenges, maintaining good mental health)
*   Differentiating between stress, distress and illness (e.g. mental health continuum, identifying signs of distress, stress management, mental illness)
*   Enhancing help-seeking efficacy (infused into various lessons)
*   Destigmatising mental illness and help seeking (e.g. stigma, mental illness)

Resilience building in the CCE curriculum employs an approach of recognising that all students are capable of developing resilience by tapping on their internal strengths and external resources. They will be introduced to the strength-based approach of ‘I am’, ‘I can’ and ‘I have’ that will fortify them when they are going through challenges and personal crises.

**Cyber Wellness**  

Through the Cyber Wellness lessons, students learn to identify harmful online behaviours, and to make responsible decisions to protect themselves and respect others so that they will be safe, respectful and responsible users of the Information and Communication Technology (ICT). The Well-being Ambassadors will organise Cyber Wellness related activities in school to promote responsible use of the internet, as well as to advocate for positive online behaviours.

  

**Education and Career Guidance**  

To meet students’ developmental needs, ECG lessons emphasise relevant knowledge, skills, values, and dispositions as students progress from primary to post-secondary school levels. At the secondary levels, topics in CCE Lessons include:

*   **_Discovering who you are_**
*   Self-Awareness and Personal Management
*   **_Making informed career decisions_**
*   Exploring and Understanding the Education Landscape
*   Exploration of Occupational Clusters
*   Identification of Relational Support and Decision Influencers
*   **_Continual learning_**
*   Adoption of Growth Mindset and Developing Enduring Dispositions

As part of the CCE lessons, PL-Lites learn more about their **RIASEC profile** on the “MySkillsFuture” portal where they discover and develop their interests and abilities, and in doing so, explore possible educational and career pathways. Lesson resources have also been created to support PL-Lites in **portfolio building** and develop their **interview skills** to prepare them for their DSA and EAE applications.

  
**National Education**

Through the celebration of the 4 commemorative events and various festivals, students learn more about the culture and history of Singapore, and to appreciate the diversity, prosperity and progress of the nation. Straits Times IN (Special Edition) and NE Forte are key dynamic resources that teachers will be provided with to engage students in discussions on issues with national significance. Through these discussions, we guide the students to make connections between the knowledge, skills and values and consider how they may apply them across different authentic contexts and situations in life. Students will also learn to reflect upon their role as citizens and how they can play a part in nation building.

  
**Assessment and Review (Product)**

As students journey through various learning and life experiences, they are encouraged to reflect on their own growth and development. Form teachers look through their students’ reflection and provide suitable feedback when necessary.
