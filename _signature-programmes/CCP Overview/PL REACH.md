PL Reach is our Values in Action programme based on the Service-Learning model, named Faithful-in-Service (FIS). FIS aims to equip our PL-Lites with the relevant knowledge and skills to instil in them good values and attitudes, while meeting real school, community, national and global needs.  
  
The PL Reach programme is designed based on a framework which focuses on the Service-Learning (S-L) methodology. We seek to serve and learn from the different people groups following the theme of P.L.M.G.S – the Pioneer Generation, Lesser Known Heroes (cleaners, migrant workers, less privileged), Moulding the Future, Green Efforts (animals and environment) and Special Needs. We hope that by the time they graduate, they would have developed an attitude of care and concern for others – through serving the community and nation in their FIS projects and being inspired to continue to serve at home, in school and beyond.  
  
**Underlying Principle of Service Learning:**  

Reciprocity – ‘I serve you in order that I may learn from you. You accept my service in order that you may teach me.’ – Timothy K Stanton  
&nbsp;  
**Objectives:**  

To develop our girls into:  
-&nbsp;**C**onfident PL-Lites who are leaders as well as team players  
-&nbsp;**C**ompassionate PL-Lites with a heart for others  
-&nbsp;**C**oncerned citizens with a strong sense of belonging and love for our country, while having global awareness of issues in the world  
  
**Approach (adapted from MOE):**  
1.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;**Educate**&nbsp;in&nbsp;**leadership**&nbsp;training and service learning  
2.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Engage in youth&nbsp;_**voice**_&nbsp;and ownership of the project&nbsp;**_(opportunity)_**  
3.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;_**Empower**_&nbsp;in implementation and execution of the project  
4.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;**Embrace**&nbsp;values in education (HEART)  
5.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;**Enjoy**&nbsp;the learning journey through reflection and celebrations  
  
**FRAMEWORK FOR PL REACH (SERVICE-
LEARNING):**

PL adopts an integrated approach to the design and implementation of the FIS programme so that there is alignment to the school’s HEART values and PL DOEs, greater integration with other school programmes and sustained partnership with external organisations. The FIS programme in PL uses the Design Thinking methodology, which has already been adopted by the D&amp;T Department in their teaching curriculum as a user-centric approach to identify and serve real needs as well as to develop empathy in students.  

  

We adapted the National Youth Council’s Campus ChangeMaker model, and developed our own programme for our students.

Cohort-specific programme are designed to meet the socio-emotional and developmental needs of students at each level using a spiral progression approach.
