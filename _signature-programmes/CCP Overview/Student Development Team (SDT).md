<p>The Student Development team (SDT) is made up of the Year Heads and Assistant Year Heads who lead in advocating and promoting the overall student development and well-being of students as aligned with the school’s vision.&nbsp;</p><p>The SDT actively works with key personnels and teachers to deepen understanding of student development and well-being needs of students by leveraging on focused group discussions (Tea with Year Heads) and data from surveys (Well-being Check-in surveys, PL Student Experience &amp; Engagement Survey) and reports (Sociograms, Peer-Support Leaders’ Reports).&nbsp;</p><p>The SDT plans and customises the total CCE curriculum (CCE lessons, student development experiences, Pastoral care &amp; guidance), social processes and initiatives which cater to the student development and well-being needs of students in the level(s). The SDT also provides recommendations in reviewing programmes and strategies to ensure coherence across the years and to address students’ needs.&nbsp;</p><p>To ensure the effective implementation of the processes and programmes, the SDT supports and guides staff in developing the required competencies in pastoral care and student management&nbsp; by conducting level meetings, sharing and training with teachers.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Key Students’ Processes and Initiatives to Promote Student Development &amp; Well-Being</strong></p><p>A caring and enabling school environment that promotes student development and well-being is&nbsp; one with adult role-modelling, positive teacher-student relationships, peer support and relationships, student voice and ownership.&nbsp;</p><p>As such, the Student Development team seeks to implement processes and programmes which supports the following:</p><ol><li><p>Promoting Positive Teacher-Student Relationships</p></li><li><p>Strengthening Peer Support &amp; Relationships</p></li><li><p>Increasing Student Voice &amp; Ownership</p></li></ol><p><strong>Promoting Positive Teacher-Student Relationships</strong></p><p>Positive interpersonal relationships between teachers and students contribute significantly to the students’ learning process. In positive Teacher-Student Relationships (TSR), students perceive they are respected, supported and valued by their teachers. When students experience positive TSR, they are more engaged in school and able to sustain their learning motivation. When teachers build positive relationships with their students, they feel a sense of security which allows them to engage more actively in interactions within the school environment, shaping their character, and social-emotional well-being and development.</p><p>In PLMGS(S), we are intentional in creating platforms such as one-to-one teacher student interaction time during Pastoral Care Lessons, Class Bonding Day and learning journeys. Since 2023, we also started our Start Right, Pit Stop and Wrap Up Programmes to create more shared experiences between teachers and students; strengthening peer and teacher- student relationships.&nbsp;</p><div class="iframe-wrapper"><iframe height="640" width="960" allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" src="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1oMDlB5dL1MFL65NHzcnkev0N8B3j95KXD3ifZrF8eao/embed?start=true&amp;loop=true&amp;delayms=3000"></iframe></div><p><strong>Strengthening Peer Support &amp; Relationships</strong></p><p>In PLMGS(S), we seek to build a school culture where students feel safe and supported hence promoting a peer support culture where students are empowered to look out and care for others, promote positive mindsets, pro-social behaviours, and mental well-being.&nbsp;</p><p>A buddy system is implemented in both the form classes and teaching groups to ensure that every student has a friend who is looking out for their well-being. 2 students are also identified in each class to be Peer Support Leaders (PSLs). PSLs can be identified by their natural qualities and dispositions such as having the desire to build class community and wanting to look out for those in need. These students are trained to connect with and support their classmates, look out for signs of distress, and when necessary, and refer them to teachers or trusted adults for additional support. PSLs are positive influencers who promote positive mindsets, pro-social behaviours both online and offline, advocate for well-being and role-model good. The PSLs also take on active roles to plan class activities which promote class bonding and strengthen peer relationships.&nbsp;</p><p>Besides the class-based PSLs, we also have a group of Sec 3 PSLs known as the Peer-Lites who help to strengthen the Peer Support relationships amongst the Secondary 1 students. The Sec 3 PSLs assist the teachers to take care and lead the Secondary 1 students in the Sec 1 iDiscover orientation programmes. They also conduct peer support lessons for the Secondary 1 students during character &amp; citizenship education lessons to strengthen peer relationships and advocate pro-social behaviours.&nbsp;</p><div class="iframe-wrapper"><iframe height="640" width="960" allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" src="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1KtYDiNqO_nJ4dQqYHHSu2ebqWADXdhJBzEbb3OkOegA/embed?start=true&amp;loop=true&amp;delayms=3000"></iframe></div><p><strong>Increasing Student Voice &amp; Ownership</strong></p><p>To establish an effective learning environment, it is critical to take into account student voices, and co-design learning approaches and activities that cater to their needs and interests. Creating space for students to be heard and encouraged to play an active role in what and how they learn, provides opportunities for them to develop agency or self-directedness, responsibility, and ownership of their learning.&nbsp; In PLMGS(S), we ensure that students’ voices are heard through platforms such as our termly tea with Year Heads session where the Year Heads engages our students in a time of discussion on key students’ processes and co-constructs solutions to improve overall student experiences and well-being.&nbsp;</p><p>We also create opportunities for students to plan and implement some aspects of character &amp; citizenship education, e.g. Values in Action (VIA) activities, Co-curricular activities (CCAs), Student Initiated Learning (PuLSE), outdoor activities such as camps, Cyber Wellness, Mental health and other peer-support initiatives&nbsp; so as to develop student agency, leadership competencies, as well as a sense of belonging to their school community.&nbsp;</p><div class="iframe-wrapper"><iframe height="640" width="960" allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" src="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1aBzcTQQ0RoOF5xM4cUepbSFmCUi7KFEjFaZfKp2vjU0/embed?start=true&amp;loop=true&amp;delayms=3000"></iframe></div><h4><strong>BLOOM Programme</strong></h4><p>The BLOOM programme is a school-based integrated support initiative that enhances learning motivation, strengthens school connectedness, and builds resilience for our students. Through this programme, students have the opportunity to participate in various group learning activities, aimed at helping them discover more about themselves and their future goals. Recognizing the significance of holistic development, the programme integrates personalized counseling support and encourages students to seek guidance and assistance from dedicated teachers and youth workers. This ensures that they receive the necessary support for their emotional and academic well-being.</p><p></p><div class="iframe-wrapper"><iframe height="640" width="960" allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" src="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1lMmKytrNhVfevFL-3o74zcJL8sRwZP8Q7XAM-bkqShA/embed?start=true&amp;loop=true&amp;delayms=3000"></iframe></div><p><br></p>
