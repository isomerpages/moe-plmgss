Form Teachers and co-Form Teachers spend time with their classes during Pastoral Care Time held on the first period of the week. Teacher also meet student individually in the morning for Teacher-Student Conferencing, where the teachers interact with the students, discuss academic issues or use Character Assist, which is a self/peer/teacher evaluation tool to track their character development.

At least once a year, teachers and students organised class outing to build class spirit and strong caring relationships within the class.

Students with special needs are also well supported in the school as the team, consisting of the Allied Educator for Learning and Behavioural Support, helps the students cope with their difficulties in class or during assessments and hence develop their potentials.

Every International Student (IS) in the school has a student buddy whom IS can approach to get help. The part-time school counselor ensures that IS are well adjusted to their new environment. Activities are also organised to promote interaction and cultural exchange between local and international students.

In addition, the school has many activities like the level camps and Values-in-Action projects, through which a strong sense of belonging in class and a strong rapport between teachers and students are built.

  

In PL Care, various segments of students with different needs are identified and appropriate care and support are provided for them.
