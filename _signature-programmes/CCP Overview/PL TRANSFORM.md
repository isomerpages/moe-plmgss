In PL, we believe that each child is special and her potential is fully realised when she is nurtured morally, intellectually, socially and physically. Therefore we seek to create an environment where there is order and discipline so that she is able to concentrate on her learning as well as to grow in self-management and integrity.

  

The discipline committee is hence named as “PL Transform” as we believe in helping our students learn from their mistakes and grow in their character. We use the 4Rs approach to guide our students in recognizing their mistakes, making restitution for her mistakes and having reconciliation with the people who have been affected by their action, and making resolution to not make the same mistake again.
