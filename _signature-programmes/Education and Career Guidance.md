<p>Our ECG programme includes a formal curriculum through LiVE and PC lessons
and also consists of various key programmes to enable PL-Lites to find
purpose through lifelong learning. We aim to equip our students with the
skills to continuously discover, plan and explore new opportunities that
come their way and this vision is in line with the&nbsp;<strong>goals of CCE 2021</strong>&nbsp;of&nbsp;<strong>future readiness</strong>.
This is so that PL-Lites have a sense of purpose in their lives and will
be equipped to take on the challenges of the future. This is defined as
‘PL-Lites with a&nbsp;<strong>positive future-orientation</strong>’.</p>

<p>The operating environment of PL(Sec)’s ECG programme is the&nbsp;<strong><em>Culture of Pathfinding</em></strong>.
Pathfinding is a journey of discovering one’s values, interests, personality
and skills and using this awareness to make the most-informed decision
on moving forward in one’s life in pursuit of actualising one’s aspirations.
It is in line with our school’s vision of nurturing “women of fine character

<p><strong>ECG 2021 Curriculum Framework</strong>
</p>
<p>Education and Career Guidance (ECG) is about equipping students with the
necessary knowledge, skills and values to make informed decisions at each
key education stage for successful transition from school to further education
or work, and hence to manage their career pathways and lifelong learning
throughout their lives. Through ECG, social emotional competencies and
qualities of proactivity, adaptability and resilience are developed to
prepare students for the 21st Century.</p>
<p>To ensure that students are adaptable, resilient and updated on ECG news
and issues, a clear and systematic ECG curriculum has been developed and
aligned to the level outcomes and needs of the PL-lites.</p>
<p>As part of the CCE lessons, PL-Lites learn more about their&nbsp;<strong>RIASEC profile</strong>&nbsp;on
the “MySkillsFuture” portal where they discover and develop their interests
and abilities, and in doing so, explore possible educational and career
pathways.</p>
<p>Since 2021, more resources have also been created to support PL-Lites
in&nbsp;<strong>portfolio building</strong>&nbsp;and develop their&nbsp;<strong>interview skills</strong>&nbsp;to
prepare them for their DSA and EAE applications.</p>
