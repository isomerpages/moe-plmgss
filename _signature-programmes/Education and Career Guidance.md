Our ECG programme includes a formal curriculum through LiVE and PC lessons and also consists of various key programmes to enable PL-Lites to find purpose through lifelong learning. We aim to equip our students with the skills to continuously discover, plan and explore new opportunities that come their way and this vision is in line with the&nbsp;**goals of CCE 2021**&nbsp;of&nbsp;**future readiness**. This is so that PL-Lites have a sense of purpose in their lives and will be equipped to take on the challenges of the future. This is defined as ‘PL-Lites with a&nbsp;**positive future-orientation**’.

**Establishing the Culture of Pathfinding in PL(Sec)**  
  
The operating environment of PL(Sec)’s ECG programme is the&nbsp;**_Culture of Pathfinding_**. Pathfinding is a journey of discovering one’s values, interests, personality and skills and using this awareness to make the most-informed decision on moving forward in one’s life in pursuit of actualising one’s aspirations. It is in line with our school’s vision of nurturing “women of fine character with a passion for life and learning”.

**ECG 2021 Curriculum Framework**  
  
Education and Career Guidance (ECG) is about equipping students with the necessary knowledge, skills and values to make informed decisions at each key education stage for successful transition from school to further education or work, and hence to manage their career pathways and lifelong learning throughout their lives. Through ECG, social emotional competencies and qualities of proactivity, adaptability and resilience are developed to prepare students for the 21st Century.  
  
To ensure that students are adaptable, resilient and updated on ECG news and issues, a clear and systematic ECG curriculum has been developed and aligned to the level outcomes and needs of the PL-lites.  
  
As part of the CCE lessons, PL-Lites learn more about their&nbsp;**RIASEC profile**&nbsp;on the “MySkillsFuture” portal where they discover and develop their interests and abilities, and in doing so, explore possible educational and career pathways.  
  
Since 2021, more resources have also been created to support PL-Lites in&nbsp;**portfolio building**&nbsp;and develop their&nbsp;**interview skills**&nbsp;to prepare them for their DSA and EAE applications.
