<h4><strong>The Arts at PLMGS(S)</strong></h4>
<p>At PLMGS(S), we believe a holistic arts education is essential for every
student. Our program, guided by a framework built on <strong>Creativity, Appreciation, Passion</strong>,
and <strong>Excellence</strong>, celebrates the arts in and out of the classroom.</p>

<p>Our arts education is a distinctive strength of the school, deeply integrated
with our Mission, Vision, and Values (MVV), which foster a culture of <strong>H.E.A.R.T</strong>.
We're dedicated to shaping every student into a woman of grace and fine
character who can appreciate the fullness and finer aspects of life.</p>
<p>We offer diverse opportunities for students to develop and showcase their
talents. From all-school Arts Assembly sessions to specialized subjects
like <a href="https://www.plmgss.moe.edu.sg/instructional-programmes/Aesthetics/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">O-Level Art, Music and Higher Music</a>,
and nine different Performing Arts CCAs, every student has a chance to
express themselves and shine. Events such as the Lower Secondary Art Exhibition,
lunchtime concerts, and the biennial showcases, <strong>Symphony of Praise</strong> and <strong>Musical Montage</strong>,
help students grow in confidence and poise while sharing their artistic
journeys with the wider community.</p>
<h4><strong>Deepening Appreciation for the Arts</strong></h4>
<p>We believe in providing authentic, first-hand experiences. Since 2023,
our Secondary 2 Performing Arts-Based Learning (PABL) program, in partnership
with the National Arts Council, has done just that. Highlights include
attending a Singapore Symphony Orchestra performance at Victoria Concert
Hall and exploring Singaporeâ€™s pop music scene through a live performance
by singer-songwriter Inch Chua. These encounters are designed to foster
aesthetic sensitivity, cultural awareness and cross-cultural literacy,
aligning with our goal of nurturing students with a global outlook.</p>
<p>Our <a href="https://www.plmgss.moe.edu.sg/co-curricular-programmes/cca-overview/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Performing Arts CCAs</a> also
provide rich opportunities for students to refine their artistry while
developing character, leadership skills and 21st-century competencies.
This holistic approach helps us achieve our Desired Outcomes of Education
(DOE).</p>
<p>Ultimately, our initiatives are about empowering every student to <strong>create, connect and contribute</strong> through
the arts. We aim to cultivate a vibrant arts culture that helps every student
become a <strong>Confident PL-Lite, Passionate Learner, Active Citizen</strong> and <strong>Inspiring Leader</strong>.</p>
