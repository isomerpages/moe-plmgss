***Day 1***

In March 2024, our Secondary Four students embarked on an enriching cultural immersion trip to Batam, Indonesia.

The first day began with a cultural exchange at the Al Jabar School, where our PL-Lites were warmly welcomed by a splendid performance of an Indonesian cultural dance that was met with resounding applause. Months of planning culminated in our students enthusiastically leading games such as _chapteh_ and the marble game, fostering meaningful interactions with their Al Jabar peers.

After lunch, our students captured a special cohort photo at the iconic “Welcome to Batam” monument. The next stop was Kampung Seni Batam, an art village adorned with vibrant murals and cultural displays. Here, PL-Lites unleashed their creativity through painting on canvases and shells, immersing themselves in the village’s rich artistic heritage.

The day concluded with students checking into their accommodations, reflecting on their experiences in group discussions and participating in a debrief session with their teachers.

***Day 2***

Day two began with a visit to Yehonala School, where our students enjoyed participating in mass games alongside their Batam counterparts. They also attended engaging lessons planned by Yehonala’s teachers and actively contributed to class discussions. A highlight was leading a devotion session, joining Yehonala teachers and students in worship, fostering a shared sense of community and faith.

To express gratitude for the warm hospitality extended by both Al Jabar and Yehonala schools, our PL-Lites presented a meaningful gift—a bird perched on a pyramid—symbolizing their heartfelt wishes for balance and harmony in life.

The cultural learning continued with visits to the Muhammad Cheng Ho Mosque, an architectural marvel blending Chinese and Indonesian elements, and the Batam Miniature Houses, showcasing the diversity of Indonesia’s traditional homes. The day ended with a trip to Kek Lapis Cottage and the Golden Factory Outlet, where students picked up souvenirs for their families.

***Day 3***

On the final day, students enjoyed a picnic at the Deer Park, bonding over heartwarming conversations and cherishing the final moments of the trip.

Although their time in Batam was short, it was filled with invaluable learning opportunities. Our PL-Lites returned as more confident individuals and passionate learners, carrying with them beautiful memories and timeless treasures as they prepare to graduate from PL.
