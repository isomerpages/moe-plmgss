**EVERY PL-LITE AN INSPIRING LEADER**  

PL Lead is a key management system of PLMGS (Sec)’s Character Development (CD) focus. In line with our school’s desired outcomes of education, our vision is that&nbsp;**every PL-Lite is a confident and inspiring leader, a young lady who takes initiative to lead self and influence others positively**. She will grow into a resilient and dedicated individual who is a role model in both her character and her choices in life.  
  
PL Lead, has established a comprehensive system to explore, develop and maximise the leadership potential of all PL-Lites. This stems from our beliefs that  
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Every student can be developed as a leader  
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Every student should be developed as a leader  
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Development must be intentional  
  
**Student Leadership Framework**  

The PL student Leadership Framework is represented in the form of a lighthouse to remind PL-Lites that they are to be a light to the community. They are to be examples in speech, in life, in love, in faith and in purity (1 Timothy 4:12). Our approach to student leadership is to equip students with the necessary values, knowledge and skills through leadership workshops and camps, and thereafter to empower them for their roles or to make a positive and impactful difference to those around them.

Activities at each student leadership developmental stage, (starting with Personal, followed by Peer and ending with People) is age-appropriate, with a focus on the themes of “iDiscover” (Sec 1), “iAspire” (Sec 2), “iInfluence” (Sec 3) and “iInspire” (Sec 4/5).  
  
PL Lead is also strongly aligned to PLMGS(S)’ Desired Outcomes of Education, with an explicit and intentional focus on the outcome – Inspiring Leader.

Upon entry into the DSA Student Leadership programme, these students will be known as Junior Leaders (JLs) and will be installed officially as JLs during Prefects Installation ceremony in Sec 1. Their DSA journey will comprise mentoring from Sec 3 senior prefects and PL Lead teachers, and opportunities to hone and apply their leadership competencies right from Secondary 1. As such, our JLs are exposed to a variety of leadership learning experiences at an earlier time. JLs will be formally emplaced into the Prefectorial Board in Secondary 2, and they are expected to commit and contribute to Prefectorial Board for all 4/5 years of their time in PL and should be potential candidates for Prefect Exco in Sec 3.
