**Prefectorial Board**

As the apex of the PL Student Leadership body, the PL Prefectorial Board is the bridge between the school leaders, teachers and students.  
Together with the Executive Committee, the Prefectorial Board oversees the following:  
  

*   Organization of school-wide events (such as iDiscover Camp, Mega Camp, Leadership Conference etc.)
*   Working alongside student leaders from other leadership groups to maintain school spirit and culture
*   Management of discipline issues of students (Decorum, late-coming)
*   Enhancement of student well-being (gathering student feedback and conducting focus group discussions to hear student voices on key issues)
*   Supporting the school in carrying out of daily duties such as flag-raising, morning announcements, ushering for special events etc.  
    

  
As student leaders of PL, prefects are given ample opportunities to hone and apply their leadership skills and competencies, and participate in external leadership workshops and seminars.  
  
**Peer Lites**  
Peer Lites are school-wide peer support leaders, who are called to shine as lights amongst their peers. Their importance is highlighted in their role as ‘big sisters’ to the incoming Secondary 1 juniors.  
  
The roles of Peer Lites are to help Secondary 1 students assimilate into the PL family by:  

*   Mentoring and befriending Secondary 1 students
*   nculcating school values through conducting the Sec 1 Peer Support Programme.  
    

  
Peer Lites are involved in co-organising the Sec 1 orientation programme – iDiscover Camp, and they also assist in the execution of school events (eg. Sports Day, Racial Harmony Day etc.) together with other leadership bodies. Peer Lites are also given opportunities to attend external leadership workshops, seminars, and be part of the organizing committees of major school events.
