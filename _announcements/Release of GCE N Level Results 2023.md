Just try your best!”</em></strong></h4><p><strong>Nurfatheha binte Abdul Latiff (4NA)</strong><br><strong><em>5 Distinctions, 7 points</em></strong><em><br>Distinctions for English, Malay, Social Studies, Science, Nutrition&nbsp; &amp; Food Science</em></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 50%;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Nlevelresults2023/nurfathena.jpg"></div><p>In the face of unimaginable adversity, Nurfateha demonstrated unwavering determination and resilience in her education journey.</p><p>Losing her father to a heart attack the year before, she exemplified courage and commitment to her studies, and turned her grief into a driving force for success. Growing up very close to her father, his sudden loss was a big blow as he had always been her source of strength. Yet, Nurfatheha decided early on that she was going to step up and was motivated to make things easier for her mother.</p><p>When one speaks to her, one is immediately struck by her mature and positive vibes. Her teachers found her to be both thoughtful and cheerful. She took responsibility for her own learning and was able to take challenges in her stride.</p><p>A helpful friend, her supportive and caring nature enabled her to build positive relationships with her peers. Her positive role-modelling in school was recognised when she was placed on the Dean's List - Character Award in 2023, along with the Edusave Scholarship, given to the top 10% of the school’s level and steam.</p><p>She regards her family and close friends as her biggest support. She is grateful to her mother for always being there for her and encouraging her even when she may not have performed her best. Her word of encouragement to her juniors would be to “never give up, even when you are at your lowest point. Just try your best!”</p><p>Nurfatheha aspires to qualify for PFP and study Psychology. She wants to learn and understand human behaviour and what motivates them to behave the way they do. Eventually, she hopes to join the Singapore Police Force.</p><h4><strong><br><em>“…take breaks, calm down and study ahead. Have good friends around you … motivate each other!”</em></strong></h4><p><strong>Kristen Loy Yan Qi (4NT)</strong><br><strong><em>6 Distinctions, 5 points</em></strong><em><br>Grade A for English(NA), Chinese, Maths, Science, EBS &amp; CPA</em></p><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 50%;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Nlevelresults2023/kristen.png"></div><p>Embarking on a rigorous study regimen that eventually led to an outstanding performance in the national-level examinations, Kirsten’s success is a testament to the belief that hard work and dedication can yield remarkable results.</p><p>Her story serves as an inspiration to all students, reminding us that with resilience and effort, every obstacle can be overcome, and dreams can be realised. A familiar name at awards’ ceremonies, she has received the Dean’s List – Academic Excellence, Edusave Character Award and PL Excellence Award, among others.</p><p>A member of the Prefectorial Board, she has served the school well as a role-model for her peers. Her teachers found her to be good-natured, sincere, and warm. She was always polite, respectful and was well-liked by both her teachers and peers.</p><p>She credits her parents for being her biggest support and remembers fondly how they would give her notes of encouragement to keep her going during the examinations. When asked if she had any advice for her juniors, she said “I’d advise my juniors to try and take breaks, calm down and study ahead. Cramming before examinations is not recommended.</p><p>Have good friends around you to help you and study together, focus on your work and motivate each other!” Kristen's story serves as a testament to the transformative power of perseverance and is as an inspiration to everyone.</p><h4>Photos on Results Release Day</h4><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Nlevelresults2023/Picture1.jpg"></div><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Nlevelresults2023/Picture2.jpg"></div><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Nlevelresults2023/Picture3.jpg"></div><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Nlevelresults2023/Picture4.jpg"></div><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Nlevelresults2023/Picture5.jpg"></div><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 45%;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Nlevelresults2023/glory.png"></div><p></p>
