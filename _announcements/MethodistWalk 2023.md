METHODISTWALK 2023 – “A MILLION FOR A MILLION”
![](/images/mwalk2023.png)
The MethodistWalk is a biennial fundraising activity organised by the Methodist Schools’ Foundation (MSF), on behalf of the Methodist schools in Singapore. Traditionally, on the last Saturday in March, student representatives from all 15 Methodist schools gather together with teachers, family members and supporters from the Methodist churches, to walk together and raise funds for the needs of individual schools. In this edition of the MethodistWalk, we have pledged to collectively walk 1,000,000km from 1 March 2023 to 25 March 2023 and to collectively raise $1,000,000. Each student would also have a pledge card with which they could seek donations from family and friends.

  
Paya Lebar Methodist Girls’ School (Secondary) will be raising funds for improvement works in the Agape Concert Hall, a non-standard facility not covered by MOE funding. Our fundraising goal is $60,000 which will help defray the estimated cost of $400,000 for replacement of the faulty air-conditioning system.  
  

We look forward to having your fullest support as we come together as a school family for MethodistWalk 2023.
