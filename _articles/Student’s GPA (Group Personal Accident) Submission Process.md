Dear parents/guardians,  
  
Since Jan 2022, NTUC Income has been offering GroupPersonalAccident (GPA) Insurance to all students which covers death, permanent and total/partial disability and medical expenses due to an accident. The claim procedure is **no longer** handled by school since Jan 2022, but is to be submitted by parents/students directly to NTUC Income.  


All claims should be submitted as soon as possible subjected to a cap of 365 days from the date of accident.
