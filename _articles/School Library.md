<h4><strong>New Services in PL Book-tique</strong></h4>
<p>The PL Book-tique will implement the following services to help you manage
your school library account and loans:
<br>
</p>
<p><strong><u>Email notifications for your loans</u></strong> (tentatively
from 7 Apr 2025)</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>You will receive a&nbsp;<strong>loan-due reminder</strong>&nbsp;<strong>3 days before your loan is due</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If your loan is&nbsp;<strong>overdue</strong>&nbsp;by&nbsp;<strong>1 day</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>7 days</strong>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<strong>30 days</strong>,
you will receive an <strong>Overdue notification.</strong>
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong><u>Loan Renewal via the Online Public Access Catalogue (OPAC</u>)</strong>
<br>You may renew a loan item (which is not due yet) via the OPAC.</p>
<p><strong><u>Reservation of an item through the OPAC<br></u></strong>You
may reserve a library item (which is currently on loan to another library
user) via the OPAC.</p>
<p>We hope you will find the above services helpful, and it will reduce the
occurrence of overdue loans and library fines.
<br>
<br>Warmest Regards
<br>PLMGS(Sec) Librarian</p>
