<h3><strong>Vision / Mission</strong></h3>
<p>To cultivate <strong>confident communicators</strong> in the Mother Tongue
Languages who demonstrate a strong passion for and appreciation of their <strong>cultural values and heritage</strong>.</p>
<h4><strong>Curriculum</strong></h4>
<p><strong>&nbsp;PL Bilingualism Framework</strong>
</p>
<p>The <strong>PL Bilingualism Programme</strong> is a two-pronged, school-wide
initiative anchored in the <strong>Mother Tongue Language (MTL) Curriculum</strong>.
It is a collaborative effort involving <strong>School Management, Teachers, Parents, Community Organisations, and Vendors</strong>,
all working together to nurture PL-Lites as confident bilinguals.</p>
<p>Aligned with the overarching goals of MTL education, the programme supports
students in <strong>Learning Languages for Life</strong> over their 4 to
5 years at PL. It is built upon the <strong>three broad objectives of MTL education</strong>:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Communication</strong> – Building proficiency in the use of the
Mother Tongue Languages in daily and real-world contexts</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Culture</strong> – Developing appreciation and understanding of
cultural values and heritage</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Connection</strong> – Strengthening personal and communal identity
through meaningful engagement with language and culture</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>These objectives underpin the <strong>2021 Secondary MTL Curriculum</strong>,
shaping its <strong>Content</strong> (Language Skills, Language Knowledge,
Cultural Values), <strong>Pedagogical Approaches</strong>, and <strong>Assessment Practices</strong>.
The PL Bilingualism Programme thus serves as a comprehensive platform to
equip students with both linguistic competence and cultural rootedness.</p>
