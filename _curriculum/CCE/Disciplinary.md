<h4><strong>Discipline and Student Development: The PL Transform Approach</strong></h4>
<p>At PL, we believe that every child is unique and has great potential.
Our goal is to create a nurturing environment where students can flourish
intellectually, socially and morally. We foster a culture of order and
discipline not just to maintain a conducive learning environment, but also
to help our students develop self-management skills and integrity.</p>
<p>Our discipline committee, known as <strong>PL Transform</strong>, is dedicated
to this mission. We see every mistake as a learning opportunity, guiding
our students to grow into women of fine character.</p>
<p>We use the <strong>4Rs approach</strong>â€”Recognition, Restitution, Reconciliation,
and Resolution, to help students learn from their actions. This process
is supported by questions based on Restorative Practice, which guide students
to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Recognize</strong> their mistake and its impact.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make <strong>Restitution</strong> to rectify the harm caused.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Seek <strong>Reconciliation</strong> with those affected.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Find a <strong>Resolution</strong> to ensure they don't repeat the mistake.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, the PL Transform team regularly conducts character talks
and friendly inter-class student management competitions to reinforce the
importance of our school's <strong>HEART values</strong>. This proactive
approach helps us build a positive and supportive school community for
everyone.</p>
