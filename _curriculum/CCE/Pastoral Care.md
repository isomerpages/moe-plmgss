<h4><strong>Pastoral Care at PLMGS(S): Nurturing Well-Being and Growth</strong></h4>
<p>At PLMGS(S), we believe that a student's well-being is the foundation
for their success. Our <strong>Pastoral Care Team</strong>, along with teachers
and key partners, is dedicated to promoting the holistic development of
every student, ensuring they feel supported, valued, and empowered to thrive.</p>
<p>We achieve this by cultivating a <strong>caring and enabling environment</strong> that
focuses on three key areas:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Building Positive Teacher-Student Relationships</strong>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Strengthening Peer Support &amp; Friendships</strong>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Increasing Student Voice &amp; Ownership</strong>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Fostering Strong Relationships</strong></h4>
<p>We know that strong, respectful relationships between students and teachers
are crucial. When students feel supported, they are more motivated and
engaged in their learning. We intentionally build these connections through:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Dedicated one-on-one time</strong> with teachers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Class Bonding Days and Learning Journeys.</strong>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>Start Right, Pit Stop, and Wrap Up</strong> programs, which
create shared experiences to strengthen bonds.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, our <strong>BLOOM Programme</strong> provides an extra layer
of support. This initiative boosts motivation, resilience, and a sense
of school connectedness through group activities and personalized counseling,
helping students set goals and find tailored support for their emotional
and academic well-being.</p>
<h4><strong>Creating a Culture of Peer Support</strong></h4>
<p>We strive to create a safe school culture where students feel supported
by their peers. We empower students to look out for one another and promote
positive mindsets through three key structures:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Circle of Friends:</strong> Every student belongs to a small, in-class
support group.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Peer Support Leaders (PSLs):</strong> Trained students who act
as role models and organize bonding activities to strengthen class relationships.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Peer-Lites:</strong> A dedicated group of senior PSLs who mentor
new Secondary 1 students during orientation and lead CCE lessons to build
positive connections.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Empowering Student Voices</strong></h4>
<p>We believe that students are key to shaping a meaningful learning environment.
By creating opportunities for their voices to be heard, we encourage them
to take ownership of their growth and contributions to the school community.</p>
<p>Platforms for student feedback and leadership include:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Tea with Year Heads:</strong> Termly dialogues where students and
school leaders co-create solutions to improve school life.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Well-Being Check-in Surveys:</strong> We use data from these surveys
to understand and respond more effectively to students' experiences.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Student-led Initiatives:</strong> Students take the lead in various
programs, from VIA and CCAs to outdoor camps and wellness initiatives,
building their leadership skills and fostering a strong sense of belonging.</p>
</li>
</ul>
