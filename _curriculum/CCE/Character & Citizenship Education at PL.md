<h4><strong>Character &amp; Citizenship Education at PL</strong></h4>
<p>At PL, we believe in nurturing every student to become a woman of fine
character with a passion for life and learning. Our vision is for every
PL-Lite to flourish into a <strong>'whole person with lives in favour with God and man'</strong> which
is a core belief that guides our entire educational philosophy.</p>
<p>Our <strong>Character and Citizenship Education (CCE)</strong> curriculum
is central to this journey. It is a dynamic, student-centric program designed
to help students discover who they are, grow their strengths and learn
to serve and lead with purpose.</p>
<p>Students are provided with opportunities to discover, grow, serve, and
lead through:</p>

</ul>
<h4><strong>Our Beliefs and Guiding Principles</strong></h4>
<p>We know that character development is a team effort. We believe that <strong>it takes a village to raise a child</strong>,
and we work in close partnership with our families and the wider community
to help our students thrive. Every staff member plays a vital role, serving
as a positive role model and mentor to help students develop our schoolâ€™s <strong>HEART values</strong>,
social-emotional competencies and citizenship dispositions.</p>
<p>Our CCE curriculum is built on two key principles:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Student-Centricity:</strong> We intentionally design programs that
cater to the unique developmental and social-emotional needs of our students.
We actively seek their input and empower them to take charge of their own
learning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Intentionality:</strong> Every lesson and activity are purposeful.
We have a clear learning outcome for each program, ensuring that students
have a breadth of experience and the right level of challenge to broaden
their learning and feel meaningfully engaged.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>A Journey of Growth: Our Learning Outcomes</strong></h4>
