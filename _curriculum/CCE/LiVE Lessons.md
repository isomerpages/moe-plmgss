<h4><strong>The PL LiVE Programme: Nurturing Character and Values</strong></h4>
<p>The PL LiVE (Lifeskills and Values Education) program is the core of our <strong>Character and Citizenship Education (CCE)</strong> curriculum.
Through weekly lessons and enrichment activities, we aim to develop students
who are not only successful but also compassionate, resilient, and well-rounded
individuals.</p>
<p>Our curriculum is designed to achieve four key goals:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Good Character:</strong> We help students develop sound values,
think ethically, and take responsibility for their choices. This is guided
by our school's <strong>HEART values</strong>, i.e. Honour God, Excellence,
Adaptability, Respect, and Thankfulness, which serve as a moral compass
for our students.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Resilience and Well-being:</strong> We equip students with the
skills to face challenges, build healthy relationships and cultivate a
sense of gratitude, all of which are essential for their well-being.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Active Citizenship:</strong> We empower students to contribute
positively to the people around them and to our nation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Future Readiness:</strong> We inspire students to find a sense
of purpose and to be prepared for the challenges and opportunities of the
future.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>A Holistic Approach to Learning</strong></h4>
<p>Our CCE curriculum is built on three main ideas: <strong>Identity, Relationships, and Choices.</strong> We
teach core values and social-emotional skills through six key content areas:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>National Education (NE)</strong>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Sexuality Education (SEd)</strong>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Mental Health (MH)</strong>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Education and Career Guidance (ECG)</strong>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cyber Wellness (CW)</strong>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Family Education (FE)</strong>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Learning goes beyond the classroom. While our teachers lead weekly discussions
in <strong>LiVE lessons</strong>, we also use a variety of platforms to
reinforce these values. For example, our <strong>Peer-Lites and Peer Support Leaders</strong> organize
activities to promote positive mental health and build strong friendships,
making sure that students feel supported in both their online and offline
lives.</p>
<p>We also believe in building <strong>resilience</strong> by helping students
understand their own internal strengths and external support systems. We
teach a strength-based approach, showing students that they are capable,
they can succeed, and they have the resources they need to overcome personal
challenges.</p>
<h4><strong>Reflection and Growth</strong></h4>
<p>A crucial part of our program is reflection. Students are encouraged to
use their <strong>LiVE reflection journal</strong> to think about their personal
growth. This helps them internalize the values and skills they have learned,
and it gives Form Teachers an opportunity to provide personalized feedback
and guidance.</p>
<p>The journey of character development is continuous, and we're committed
to supporting every student as she grows into a confident, compassionate,
and resilient young woman.</p>
