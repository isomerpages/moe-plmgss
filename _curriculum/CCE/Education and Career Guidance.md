<h4><strong>Education and Career Guidance (ECG) at PL(Sec)</strong></h4>
<p>Our vision is to nurture women of fine character with a passion for life
and learning. The Education and Career Guidance (ECG) program is a key
part of this vision, empowering every PL-Lite to become a "pathfinder",
someone who actively discovers her strengths, makes informed choices and
forges her own fulfilling future.</p>
<p>Our ECG program is designed to develop students who have a <strong>positive future-orientation</strong> and
are equipped to take on the challenges of the future.</p>
<h4><strong>Our Approach: A Culture of Pathfinding</strong></h4>
<p>We believe that every student's journey is unique. Our <strong>Culture of Pathfinding</strong> helps
students explore their interests, skills and values to make the best decisions
about their future. This is supported by three key themes:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Discover Who You Are:</strong> We help students understand their
unique interests, abilities, and passions, and show them how these can
contribute meaningfully to society through their future professions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Navigate Pathways with Confidence:</strong> Students learn about
various educational and career pathways, enabling them to make well-considered
decisions and take the first steps toward their goals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Keep Learning. Be Resilient:</strong> We equip students with essential
21st-century skills, such as adaptability and resilience, to prepare them
for a lifetime of learning and career growth.</p>
</li>
</ul>
