<h4><strong>Mission</strong></h4>
<p>To develop students into critical thinkers, effective communicators, and
empathetic readers through engaging and thoughtfully designed English Language
and Literature programmes. We aim to nurture a love for language and empower
students to express themselves with clarity, confidence, and purpose in
both academic and real-world contexts.</p>
<h4><strong>Vision</strong></h4>
<p>To create a culture where students are <strong><em>articulate</em></strong><em> and </em><strong><em>confident</em></strong> in
the use of the English Language</p>
<h4><strong>Curriculum</strong></h4>
<p><strong>English Language</strong>
</p>
<p>In PLMGS(S), we aim to develop our students into <strong>confident and articulate speakers, avid readers and creative writers</strong>.
To achieve this, we provide an enabling environment and meaningful platforms
that challenge our students to strive for higher standards of language
use.</p>
<p>We adopt a multi-pronged approach to develop language mastery, taking
into account students’ diverse abilities, interests, and needs. Through
our curriculum, students <strong>apply Emerging 21st Century Competencies such as Critical, Adaptive and Inventive Thinking, Communication, Collaboration and Information Skills as well as Civic, Global and Cross-Cultural Literacy</strong>.
These competencies are integrated into lessons and oral communication platforms,
supporting the development of <strong>Empathetic Communicators, Discerning Readers and Creative Inquirers</strong>.</p>
<p>The effective use of English is built on a strong foundation and enriched
learning experiences for all. Our department aligns closely with the English
Language Syllabus 2020 in the design and delivery of our programmes.</p>
<p><strong>Literature in English</strong>
</p>
<p>The study of Literature in English at PLMGSS deepens students’ understanding
of the language and nurtures their appreciation of diverse literary genres.
Our goal is to develop our students into <strong>Critical Readers, Creative Meaning-makers, Convincing Communicators, as well as Global and Empathetic thinkers</strong>.</p>
<p>Our Literature curriculum is anchored in the Literary Response Framework,
which guides students in <strong>Experiencing the Story, Appreciating Style and Interpreting Theme</strong>.<strong> </strong>Through
discussion and writing, teachers actively foster students’ engagement and
personal response to texts.</p>

<p><strong>English Language</strong>
</p>
<p>In response to the evolving English Language (EL) teaching and learning
landscape, our curriculum is designed to strengthen students’ <strong>multiliteracies, metacognitive skills and exploratory talk</strong>.
These elements support the development of 21st Century Competencies across
all aspects of language learning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Literature in English</strong>
</p>
<p>Students explore the three main literary genres—prose, poetry, and drama—which
encourage both breadth and depth of reading. Literature lessons are rich
in discussion and written expression, providing a dynamic environment where
meaningful dialogue unfolds. Teachers guide students in connecting texts
to their own lives and the broader world, deepening both literary appreciation
and critical thinking.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Assessment</strong></h4>
<p>Effective teaching begins with a clear understanding of students’ evolving
needs, abilities and interests. Teachers use these insights to adapt their
methods and provide targeted feedback that supports continuous learning
and growth.</p>
<p>Assessments are aligned to the syllabus aims and learning outcomes. A
wide range of both formal and informal assessment modes are used to develop
diverse skills, learning strategies, attitudes and behaviours. Assessment
tasks are designed with consideration of students’ varied strengths, challenges
and learning goals.</p>
<p>The range of assessment modes and activities include:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Informal tests and quizzes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Interactive classroom activities (e.g. exploring genres through song,
creating symbolic artefacts, debates)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Integration of e-pedagogy to foster perspective-taking</p>
