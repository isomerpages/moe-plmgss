<h4><strong>Vision</strong></h4>
<p>To nurture in students a passion for Science</p>
<h4><strong>Mission</strong></h4>
<p>To develop independent learners and critical thinkers who apply scientific
knowledge to make meaningful contributions to society</p>
<h4><strong>Curriculum</strong></h4>
<p>Science learning in PL is purposefully designed to achieve the following
objectives:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Develop Critical Thinking and Process Skills</strong>
<br>Through inquiry-based learning, students are equipped with analytical
and problem-solving skills essential for scientific thinking.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Ignite a Passion for Lifelong Learning</strong>
<br>We aim to foster independent, meaningful, and sustained interest in Science
that extends beyond the classroom.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Inculcate Values and Attitudes</strong>
<br>Teachers model positive values to guide students in making discerning
choices and becoming responsible contributors to society and stewards of
the environment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Appreciate the World God Has Created</strong>
<br>Students are encouraged to value and care for the natural world as part
of their learning journey</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Focus for 2025</strong>
</p>
<p>In 2025, the department will focus on the intentional use of <strong>active learning strategies</strong> and <strong>success criteria</strong> to
enhance teaching and learning.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Teachers</strong> will design lessons that incorporate success
criteria at different stages of learning to monitor progress and provide
targeted feedback effectively.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Students</strong> will engage as <strong>active and self-regulated learners</strong>,
using success criteria regularly to reflect on their understanding, articulate
their learning gaps, and take ownership of their improvement.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Subjects offered</strong></h4>
<p>The Science department in PL offers a range of G1 to G3 subjects in lower
and upper Secondary.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>G1 / NT Science offered at all levels</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>G2 and G3 subjects includes Combined Science (Biology Chemistry) and Combined
Science (Chemistry/ Physics)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>G3 Science also includes Biology, Chemistry and Physics</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Assessment</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Purpose of assessment</strong>
<br>Assessment in Science lessons aims to gather and analyse evidence about
students’ learning to enhance the learning experience of students. With
clarity of purpose, different assessments provide quantitative and qualitative
information of learners’ progress and development that can be analysed
and used to provide feedback for improving practices.</p>
<p>Feedback is provided to students to help them understand strengths and
weaknesses where they can monitor their own progress.</p>
<p><strong>Types of assessment</strong>
<br>Both assessment for learning and assessment of learning help in moving
learning forward.</p>
<p><strong>Assessment for learning</strong>
<br>Students use success criteria, feedback from learning tasks in class to
monitor their own learning to close learning gaps.</p>
<p>Teachers use real-world contexts involving Science in daily life, society
and environment in the construction of assessment tasks. The information
collected is then used to adjust their teaching and learning practices.
Different evidence of learning is collected from different platforms including
practical work, worksheets, and with the use of technology such as SLS
learning packages during classroom instructions to provide timely feedback
and interventions to close students’ learning gaps.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Assessment of Learning</strong>
<br>Weighted assessments and End-of-Year examinations are designed to cover
the different assessment objectives and represent the scope and relevance
with appropriate pitching as required of the syllabus to inform how well
students had learnt at various checkpoints.&nbsp;</p>
