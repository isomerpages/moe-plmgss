<h4><strong>Mission</strong></h4>
<p>To develop PL-Lites into confident, independent and collaborative learners
who have an inquiring mind and appreciate design and the arts.</p>
<h4><strong>Vision</strong></h4>
<p>Every PL-Lite is a self-directed, creative and resilient learner who respects
diversity and solves real world problems.</p>
<h4><strong>Curriculum</strong></h4>
<p>The Aesthetics Department adopts Kolb’s Experiential Learning Theory and
learning styles model as the foundation of its curriculum framework. Kolb’s
learning cycle comprises four stages, through which experience is transformed
into meaningful learning. These stages are:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Concrete Experience (CE): The learner actively participates in an experience,
such as a practical or hands-on lesson.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reflective Observation (RO): The learner reflects on the experience from
different perspectives.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Abstract Conceptualization (AC): The learner develops theories or models
to explain what was observed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Active Experimentation (AE): The learner applies the new understanding
through testing and planning for future experiences.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>This model supports the development of higher-order thinking skills, essential
for 21st-century learners, moving beyond rote memorization to critical
and conceptual thinking which begin with big ideas that serve as lenses
through which students engage with content. Teaching through concepts provides
focus, encourages transfer of learning across contexts and fosters deeper
understanding. When instruction<strong> </strong>is concept-driven, students
gain more than factual knowledge—they are equipped to make connections,
apply ideas, and think critically.</p>
<p>In addition, the department is committed to delivering a rigorous Aesthetics
curriculum that cultivates higher-order thinking, deep understanding, meaningful
conversations and connections beyond the classroom. Learning experiences
are intentionally designed to bridge prior knowledge with new insights,
and to offer pupils opportunities to explore their interests and express
their ideas in both instruction and assessment. Lessons are grounded in
real-world contexts, helping students make authentic connections and develop
transferable skills.</p>

<h4><strong>Teaching and Learning Approaches</strong></h4>
<p><strong>&nbsp;Art</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>The Art Programme at PLMGS (Secondary) offers students a meaningful journey
of exploration, appreciation and creative expression. Through hands-on
activities, consultations, group sharing, and museum visits, students develop
their artistic style, techniques and the ability to articulate their ideas.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Our <strong>inquiry-based approach</strong> places students at the centre
of learning, encouraging exploration, discussion and reflection. Students
investigate artistic conventions and concepts through the study of artists,
artworks and art history, while developing critical thinking skills through
the art-making process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They are exposed to a variety of media and technologies to create original
and innovative works. These experiences prepare them for a future shaped
by creativity and innovation. Student artworks are regularly exhibited
in school spaces and showcases.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Grounded in Kolb’s Experiential Learning Theory, the programme allows
students to learn through a dynamic cycle of hands-on artmaking, reflection,
idea development and creative expression, fostering deeper engagement and
meaningful learning.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>Design and Technology (D&amp;T)</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>The D&amp;T programme equips students with essential life skills, fostering
creativity, innovation and problem-solving through hands-on experiences
with everyday materials. Students learn to appreciate how products are
designed and made, while developing resilience and critical thinking.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Learning is anchored in the Design Thinking approach, where students empathise,
ideate, prototype and test solutions to real-world problems. This aligns
with Kolb’s Experiential Learning Theory, which emphasises learning through
experience, reflection, conceptualisation and experimentation.</p>
</li>

<p>In our Makerspace, girls are diving into hands-on projects that blend
creativity with skill-building. Through leathercrafting, they’re designing
sleek card holders—learning to cut, stitch, and emboss leather while mastering
precision and patience. In the sewing station, they craft pouches and keychains,
experimenting with fabrics, patterns, and stitching techniques to bring
their ideas to life.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The next musical box project will introduce them to basic engineering
as they assemble wooden boxes from scratch. They're measuring, sanding,
and assembling the pieces while learning fundamental woodworking skills.
This project teaches them about structural design, tool safety, and the
satisfaction of building something durable with their own hands.</p>
</li>
