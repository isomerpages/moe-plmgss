Social Studies), nurturing well-informed, analytical, creative and critical
thinkers who are responsible global citizens capable of collaborating across
cultures and contexts.</p>
<h4><strong>Mission</strong></h4>

challenges, enabling students to understand their impact on people’s lives

<h4><strong>Enrichment and Competitions</strong></h4>
<p><strong>MOE Humanities Challenge: </strong>Selected students participate
annually in the MOE Geography and History Challenges. These competitions
provide Humanities-inclined students with platforms to sharpen their knowledge
and critical thinking. High-performing participants may also qualify for
the Humanities Talent Development Programme at the A-Level.</p>
<p><strong>Historical Scene Investigation (HSI) Challenge: </strong>Students
role-play as young historians to analyse sources, investigate historical
events, and construct evidence-based arguments. This national competition
fosters critical thinking, historical inquiry and a deeper appreciation
for Singapore’s past.</p>
<p><strong>Prove It! Contest: </strong>Through this competition organised
by the National Library Board, students develop news and information literacy
through research and multimedia storytelling. The experience hones their
critical thinking, media literacy and communication skills which are essential
for responsible digital citizenship.</p>
<p><strong>Guest Speakers and Expert Talks: </strong>External speakers are
invited to share real-world insights and professional expertise with students.
These sessions connect classroom learning with global contexts and inspire
students to think beyond their textbooks.</p>
<p><strong>Model United Nations (MUN) Conference: </strong>Students participate
in MUN conferences to engage with global issues, practice diplomacy and
develop confidence in public speaking and argumentation. These experiences
cultivate global awareness and leadership.</p>
<h4><strong>Assessment</strong></h4>
<p>Assessment in Humanities is holistic and multidimensional, allowing students
to demonstrate both their cognitive understanding and disciplinary thinking
skills. This aligns with MOE’s emphasis on nurturing future-ready learners
who are informed, concerned and participative citizens.</p>
<p>We adopt a balanced approach to assessment, combining both <strong>formative</strong> and <strong>summative</strong> methods
to give a holistic view of student learning.</p>

<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Source-based questions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Structured and essay-type responses</p>
</li>

</li>
<li>
<p>Inquiry-based investigations</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Formative</strong>  <strong>assessment</strong>
</p>
<p>Formative assessments are integrated into classroom instruction to monitor
students’ progress, provide feedback and inform teaching. These practices
are designed to address both content knowledge and disciplinary thinking
skills.</p>
