<h4><strong>Our Beliefs About Assessment </strong>(akin Assessment in the Singapore Curriculum Philosophy)</h4>
<p>We believe that assessment is integral to the teaching and learning process,
and helps our students become self-directed, lifelong learners, as they
monitor, assess, and improve their own learning. We design assessments
with clarity of purpose to gather evidence of our learners’ progress, provide
timely and targeted feedback to them to move their learning forward, and
to improve our teaching practices, harnessing technology where useful.</p>
<p>In this regard, we value “Learner-Centred and Balanced Assessment”, which
aims to</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Create a learning path to support and enhance learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improve student engagement and motivation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bring about higher achievement and greater confidence to learn</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, assessment practices can dynamically vary in the extent to
which formative and summative purposes are emphasised, depending on the
teaching and learning process. School-Based Assessment are primarily formative
in nature.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In addition to regular formative assessment feedback students receive
in their daily learning, summative assessment is largely in the form of
class assignments, tests and examinations that are planned with the intent
to enable your daughter/ward to evaluate and chart her learning progress
in consultation with her teachers. Marks will be used for promotion at
the end of the year in addition to teachers' feedback on the students'
learning dispositions and attitude. There will be no retention of Sec 1
students from 2024, in support of Full SBB efforts. Instead students will
be guided to take subject(s)at a more/less demanding level based on their
abilities. Our teachers will guide and work with the students to strengthen
their learning. It will also enable the teachers to provide targeted assistance
to strengthen her learning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Summative assessment for students in the non-graduating levels (Sec 1,
2 and 3 levels) will include Termly Weighted Assessments (WAs) as well
as one End-of-Year (EOY) Examination.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The weighting for the WAs and the EOY Examinations is as follows:</p>

<p>Please note that assessment for some subjects will be conducted as <strong>class tests or coursework.</strong> For
subjects such as Design &amp; Technology (D&amp;T) and Food &amp; Consumer
Education (FCE), there will not be any EOY Examinations for these two subjects.
Hence, their assessment weighting will be:</p>

<p>Assessments in non-Tamil Indian Languages (e.g. Punjabi) and Foreign Languages
are conducted at the MOE Language Centres. An overall grade will be given
by the Centres and this grade will be taken as the student’s EOY Examinations
result.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The school will conduct WAs continuously in Term 1 - 3 for students. This
will minimise disruption to curriculum, CCAs and other school related enrichment
activities. Please help us to ensure that your daughter/ward revises her
work consistently and is prepared for the various assessments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Students will receive their assessment feedback once the grading is completed.
Students will discuss and review the feedback and learning in class with
their teachers. Students are encouraged to share their learning and performance
with their parents/guardians. Parents/Guardians will receive your daughter/ward’s
Term Result Slip at the start of the following term.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For WAs - Should a student be absent on the day of WA, she will need to
provide a&nbsp;valid Medical Certificate*. She will receive the assessment
papers for self timed-practice and ‘MC’ status will be indicated for the
paper. (*Noted that: An MC that is issued by a Chinese Physician and letter
of excuse from parent are&nbsp;INVALID).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For Exam - Should a student be absent on the day of exam paper, she will
need to provide a&nbsp;valid Medical Certificate, a ‘MC’ status will be
indicated for the paper. A student who is absent from an examination without
a MC will get an ‘AB’ status (equivalent to zero mark attainment).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Parents/Guardians should ensure that their daughters/wards attend school
regularly. Students will not be allowed to take her Examinations at the
end of the year if her attendance&nbsp;falls below 80% and is absent without
valid reasons.</p>
