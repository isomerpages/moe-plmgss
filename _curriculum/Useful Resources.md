<h4>PL 21 Resources for students</h4>
<p>The PL 21 programme is a 2-year programme for Sec 1 and Sec 2 PL-Lites
developed by our Staff, in alignment to MOE’s Framework for 21st Century
Competencies and Student Outcomes. The PL 21 programme seeks to develop
in our students the 21st Century Competencies (21CC) necessary for the
globalised world we live in. A part of the PL programme involves the explicit
teaching of life skills to help nurture a sense of agency within the girls.</p>
<p>These skills are summarized in the following posters as a handy collection
of posters for quick reference, whenever the girls need to draw upon what
they have learnt.</p>
