<p><strong>Sports Education Programme</strong>
<br>To encourage greater student participation in sports, all Secondary 1
students take part in the Sports Education Programme, where they learn
a new sport not covered in the PE curriculum (e.g. tennis, football). Secondary
2 students are taught cycling skills in preparation for the MOE-OBS Challenge
Programme in Secondary 3. Furthermore, the Active Youth Programme, in partnership
with the Health Promotion Board (HPB), is conducted on selected Wednesday
afternoons to promote active living.</p>
<p><strong>FREE PLAY @ PL</strong>
<br>Free Play @ PL was introduced to promote spontaneous and self-directed
physical activity. A variety of sports equipment, including frisbees, table
tennis sets, and basketballs, are made available for both students and
staff to borrow and enjoy during their leisure time.</p>
<p><strong>PL Gym</strong>
<br>The PL Gym provides a conducive environment for students, staff, and parents
to maintain a regular fitness routine. A gym instructor is stationed on-site
to offer personalised guidance and customised exercise programmes for each
gym user.</p>
