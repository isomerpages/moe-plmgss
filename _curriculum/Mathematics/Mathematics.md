<h4><strong>Vision</strong></h4>
<p>To develop students into creative and analytical thinkers through problem
solving and the mastery of mathematical skills</p>
<h4><strong>Mission</strong></h4>
<p>To nurture students to be persevering and responsible learners who enjoy,
value and apply mathematics to their daily life.</p>
<h4><strong>Curriculum</strong></h4>
<p>At PL, the Mathematics Department is committed to nurturing a strong foundation
in mathematical concepts while equipping students with critical thinking
and problem-solving skills. Through a well-structured curriculum and innovative
teaching strategies, we create engaging and meaningful learning experiences
that prepare students for the demands of the 21st century.</p>
<p>Our curriculum promotes <strong>critical thinking</strong>, <strong>logical reasoning</strong>,
and <strong>effective communication</strong>, empowering students to work
independently and collaboratively in solving complex problems. By leveraging <strong>ICT tools</strong>,
students deepen their understanding, engage in exploratory problem-solving,
and apply mathematical concepts to real-world contexts.</p>
<p>Through <strong>inquiry-based learning</strong> and <strong>authentic applications</strong>,
students gain awareness of global and societal issues, enabling them to
appreciate the relevance and impact of mathematics in everyday life.</p>
<p>Beyond skill mastery, we strive to cultivate <strong>curiosity</strong>, <strong>creativity</strong>,
and a mindset of <strong>lifelong learning</strong>. By encouraging students
to think critically, reason logically, and innovate, we aim to develop
adaptable problem-solvers and confident learners—ready to embrace future
challenges with resilience and purpose.</p>
<h4><strong>Subjects offered</strong></h4>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Elementary Mathematics for all levels (G1 to G3)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Additional Mathematics for upper secondary (G2 and G3)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Principles of accounts for upper secondary (G2 and G3)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Pedagogical Approaches and Key Initiatives</strong></h4>
<p>Mathematics learning at PL is <strong>interactive, inquiry-driven, and student-centered</strong>,
fostering deep engagement, critical thinking, and meaningful learning.
Our curriculum is carefully designed to align students’ interests and developmental
needs, ensuring active participation and ownership of learning.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Real-World Applications</strong>: Lessons incorporate authentic
contexts, helping students see the relevance of mathematics in daily life.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Collaborative Learning</strong>: Through group discussions, peer
teaching, and problem-solving challenges, students develop teamwork, communication,
and deeper conceptual understanding.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Differentiated Instruction</strong>: Tailored support and challenges
allow all students to maximise their potential, catering to a range of
abilities and learning styles.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>E-Pedagogy Integration</strong>: The use of interactive platforms,
visualisers, and simulations enhances engagement and interactivity in lessons.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Assessment for Learning</strong> (<strong>AfL</strong>): Timely
feedback and formative assessments guide learning and support a growth
mindset. Student voice is valued, and learners are encouraged to reflect,
take responsibility, and actively shape their learning journey.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Focus on 21st Century Competencies (E21CC)</strong></h4>
<p>Students are guided to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Pose questions and engage in <strong>logical reasoning</strong> and <strong>mathematical argumentation</strong>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Justify claims and critique explanations using evidence</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Devise multiple strategies and construct <strong>mathematical models</strong> to
represent real-world situations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Navigate <strong>ambiguity and complexity</strong>, building inventive
thinking and resilience</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We also incorporate <strong>Polya’s 4-Step Problem-Solving Approach</strong> and
the use of <strong>heuristics</strong> to equip students with structured
strategies to tackle both routine and non-routine challenges effectively.</p>
<h4><strong>Signature Programmes &amp; Enrichment</strong></h4>
<p>Our department provides students with opportunities to participate in
a wide range of national and international competitions, enabling them
to apply mathematical thinking beyond the classroom:</p>
